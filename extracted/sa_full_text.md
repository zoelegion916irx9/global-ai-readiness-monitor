FOREWORD 
 
 
We have officially entered the Age of Artificial Intelligence. The world is now set to change at a pace not seen in 
decades, even centuries. AI-based tools and applications make our lives easier, smoother, and richer. They help us 
move efficiently, get informed, get credit, get a job, and get our taxes done. 
But in its current form, AI reproduces and amplifies many of the social challenges we face. It is not acceptable that 
around a third of the world’s population still lacks adequate internet access. Upstream, the AI industry is highly 
concentrated, with just two countries – the United States and China – and a dozen companies accounting for a 
major share of the sector. This can lead only to greater inequality of outcomes – including gender disparities – 
downstream. Non-diverse AI teams, unrepresentative datasets, and opaque and biased algorithms can cause harm, 
particularly to those who are already vulnerable, whether companies or individuals, children and young people, 
women, or entire democracies. 
That is why UNESCO drafted the Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, which was adopted in 2021 
by 193 countries to make sure AI delivers fair, sustainable, and inclusive outcomes. The Recommendation is based on 
the protection and promotion of human rights, human dignity, and environmental sustainability, and these values 
are then translated into principles such as accountability, transparency, and privacy. The Recommendation also sets 
out concrete policy actions that governments can draw on to steer technological developments in a responsible 
direction, premised on the belief that light-touch regulation, which has until now remained the norm, is insufficient. 
We need capable governments that are well equipped, in terms of competencies, institutions and laws, to frame 
responsible AI development and protect the rule of law online, and public and private developers who are 
accountable for putting human rights and fundamental freedoms – not profits or geopolitical considerations – first. 
The Readiness Assessment Methodology (RAM) is a diagnostic tool intended to assist Member States in upholding 
their commitment to the Recommendation by helping them understand how prepared they are to implement AI 
ethically and responsibly for all their citizens. By highlighting any institutional, regulatory, or data gaps and obstacles, 
it enables UNESCO to tailor support for governments to fill those gaps to ensure an ethical AI ecosystem aligned 
with the Recommendation. 
This report throws a spotlight on the rapid evolution of the AI landscape in Saudi Arabia. RAM identifies several key 
strengths bolstering this burgeoning ecosystem. The Saudi Data and AI Authority (SDAIA) has developed a robust 
governance framework committed to providing strategic oversight and aligning AI development with ethical 
standards. Significant investments in AI research, infrastructure, and education, including initiatives like the KAUST-
SDAIA Centre of Excellence, are fostering innovation and talent development. Additionally, efforts to promote 
inclusion and diversity, such as the Elevate Program, underscore a commitment to bridging digital gender gaps and 
empowering women in AI-related fields. We have also been delighted to see the recent launch of the International 
Center for Artificial Intelligence Research and Ethics (ICAIRE) as a Category 2 Centre under the auspices of UNESCO 
and look forward to a fruitful collaboration on advancing ethical AI.

### Page 11

The assessment also identifies significant challenges that must be overcome to ensure that Saudi Arabia reaches its 
full potential in AI. These include a shortage of AI talent, limited infrastructure readiness among government entities 
and private businesses, and difficulties translating research into scalable AI products. While the Kingdom’s regulatory 
framework is evolving, sector-specific sandboxes and more effective public-private partnerships will help refine AI 
applications. Gender disparities in STEM and a slow-growing startup ecosystem further underscore areas requiring 
attention. The report provides key recommendations to address these challenges through targeted reforms, capacity 
building, and improvements to the investment ecosystem, to ensure that Saudi Arabia continues to grow its AI 
landscape in an ethical, inclusive and sustainable manner. 
Overall, this report presents a fundamentally optimistic vision that we at UNESCO share: that ethical governance and 
responsible regulation of AI is entirely consistent with innovation and economic growth and is essential for ensuring 
a technological ecosystem that benefits the public good. With the RAM data and this report, the Kingdom of Saudi 
Arabia has a clear roadmap for how to get there. 
It was a pleasure working with the Government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to conduct this exercise. We are 
grateful for their engagement with the RAM, and I am sure that by following the path laid out in this report, the 
Kingdom will be able to reap the benefits of AI while making sure that AI technologies deliver fair, sustainable, and 
inclusive outcomes.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) globally presents both unprecedented opportunities and 
significant challenges. UNESCO has been at the forefront of global efforts to ensure that the rapid advancements in 
AI are aligned with ethical principles that protect human rights, dignity, and the environment. In 2021, UNESCO's 193 
Member States adopted the Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, which serves as a global 
standard to guide countries in leveraging the positive impacts of AI while addressing its inherent risks.  
To assist Member States in evaluating their preparedness to implement AI responsibly, UNESCO developed the 
Readiness Assessment Methodology (RAM). The RAM is a macro-level diagnostic tool that offers a thorough 
evaluation of a country's institutional and regulatory frameworks needed to govern AI effectively. By pinpointing 
existing gaps and areas for improvement, the RAM ensures nations are well-equipped with the necessary human 
resources, policies, and regulations to address the complex challenges posed by AI, guiding AI development in a 
manner that prioritises ethical considerations. 
The RAM comprises eight key stages: 
1. 
Diagnosis of the National AI Landscape: This stage provides a comprehensive overview of the Saudi Arabia’s 
national AI journey, including AI governance in the country and the international achievements. 
2. Legal And Regulatory: This stage provides Saudi Arabia’s comprehensive guidelines and legal framework, 
including the Personal Data Protection Law and AI Ethics Principles, ensuring responsible and secure AI 
adoption. 
3. Social And Cultural: This stage illustrates Saudi Arabia’s significant progress in promoting diversity and 
inclusion. 
4. Scientific And Educational: This stage provides an overview of Saudi Arabia’s efforts to advance AI through 
robust R&D initiatives and significant research output.  
5. Economic: This section highlights Saudi Arabia’s strategic efforts to integrate AI into its economy, addressing 
the increasing demand for AI talent in the labour market. 
6. Technical And Infrastructural: This section explores Saudi Arabia’s progress in building a robust technical 
and infrastructural foundation for AI. 
7. 
Development of a National AI Multi-Stakeholder Roadmap: In this stage, the assessment focuses on 
engaging stakeholders from various sectors to gather insights and establish a collaborative approach to AI 
governance. 
8. Formulation of Policy Recommendations: The final stage of the RAM process involves creating tailored 
recommendations that address the country's specific needs, challenges, and opportunities in AI 
development.

The Personal Data Protection Law (PDPL)25 
Saudi Arabia's Personal Data Protection Law (PDPL), issued in September 2021 and amended in March 2023, sets a 
comprehensive framework of 43 articles for managing personal data collection, processing, and protection across 
public and private sectors. Enforced from September 2024, the PDPL establishes stringent standards to ensure data 
protection and individual rights to access, correct, or delete their data, enhancing transparency and security. Its 
amendments, presented on the public consultation platform Istitlaa, received input from key international and local 
stakeholders who provided compliance guidance. The PDPL empowers individuals to control their data, allowing 
requests for data deletion or withdrawal of processing consent. It mandates data controllers to obtain explicit 
consent, with Articles 5 and 13 highlighting consent for data processing, use restrictions, and disclosure 
requirements.  
Transparency is enforced through Articles 12 and 13, which require data controllers to provide privacy policies 
detailing data use and rights. The law enforces data minimization (Article 11), limiting data collection to what is 
necessary and mandating deletion when data is no longer needed. Privacy impact assessments (Article 22) are 
required for new products or services. Article 23 ensures that sensitive data, such as health or biometric information, 
is processed only by essential personnel with additional protections. Violations of the PDPL carry severe penalties, 
including fines up to five million Saudi Riyals and imprisonment, with compensation available to affected individuals.  
Public entities have certain exceptions for data processing for security and judicial purposes (Articles 6 and 15), while 
private entities adhere to stricter consent requirements. Article 1 protects personal and family privacy, and the 
National Data Management Office, under SDAIA, oversees PDPL compliance, with all government bodies required to 
establish Data Management Offices, further promoting data governance in line with PDPL standards. 
Data Sharing and Accessibility  
The Data Sharing Policy26 developed by the NDMO in 2020 sets the framework for securely and ethically sharing 
data among Saudi government entities, private sector and individuals. It mandates that data sharing be conducted 
transparently, for legitimate purposes, and with proper authorisation. The policy applies to all types of government-
produced data and excludes private or individual data. 
Key principles include promoting a culture of data sharing to avoid duplication, ensuring secure access, and holding 
all relevant parties accountable. A clear, step-by-step process for data sharing is outlined, requiring formal 
agreements to manage and protect shared data. The policy also includes general rules for secure data transfer, 
personal data protection, and dispute resolution, emphasising a balance between data sharing and confidentiality. 
In line with the principles of the Data Sharing Policy, KSA has launched the National Data Bank (NDB) 27 as a 
constellation of KSA data platforms, including: 
• 
The National Data Lake (85+ TB of data uploaded) 
• 
The Data Marketplace (409+ APIs available for subscription) 
• 
Collaborative Data Labs (50+ reports generated) 
• 
The National Data Catalogue (300+ KPIs defined and 2190+ data standards uploaded) 
• 
The Reference Data Platform (200+ standardised reference tables available) 
• 
The Open Data Platform (9,500+ datasets available).

Although Saudi Arabia has not signed the International Open Data Charter, the Kingdom has achieved significant 
milestones in open data and e-government development. KSA is ranked 6th globally on the UN E-Government 
Development Index (EGDI) and achieved the first place in the Open Government Data Initiative (OGDI) pillar. As part 
of its ambition to develop E-Government, the Kingdom has recognised the importance of unlocking the power of 
Open Data.  
Furthermore, KSA ranks 69th on the 2022 Open Data Inventory Ranking (ODIN)28, highlighting significant 
improvements in the past couple of years.  The previous indicators shows that Saudi Arabia has been proactive in 
advancing its open data agenda, undertaking various initiatives to align with global practices. A key component of 
this effort is the National Data Index (NDI), which was developed to improve government data management 
practices. The NDI serves as a crucial framework for standardising data management across different sectors, 
enabling better decision-making and fostering transparency. 
Multiple initiatives and programmes are being launched with the objective of increasing the Kingdom’s ranking in 
key international indexes such as the UN E-Government Index and the Open Data Barometer, the Kingdom provides 
high-quality open data to drive economic growth and foster innovation. 
 
PROCUREMENT LAWS AND POLICIES  
PROCUREMENT LAWS AND POLICIES 
 
As of today, there is no direct law or policy for the procurement of AI systems, or products and services that include 
AI components. However, KSA has adopted the AI Ethics Principles, which specify that for an AI system built by a 
third party, AI system owners should ensure that an AI Ethics due diligence is carried out. This due diligence involves 
assessing the ethical implications of the AI system, including its design, functionality, and potential impact on users 
and society.  
Key aspects of this process include evaluating the fairness, accountability, and transparency of the AI system, as well 
as ensuring compliance with data protection and privacy laws. Additionally, all relevant documentation must be 
accessible and traceable before procurement or sign-off. In this context, there is no list of certified vendors with AI-
related provisions, but a voluntary digital badges programme for AI compliance was launched in Global AI Summit in 
Riyadh 2024. 
 
FREEDOM OF  INFORMATION ACTS AN D ACCESS TO KNOWLEDGE ACTS  
FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACTS AND ACCESS TO KNOWLEDGE ACTS 
 
The Freedom of Information Policy29 developed in 2020 by the National Data Management Office (NDMO) establish 
the legal framework for individuals' rights to access unprotected public sector information and outline the obligations 
of public entities. This includes requests from any individual to access or obtain unprotected information produced 
or held by public entities, regardless of its source, form, or nature. It applies to all types of recorded information, 
such as emails, digital files, handwritten notes, and more.

Key principles of the regulations include: 
• 
Transparency: ensuring individuals have the right to access public information to enhance accountability; 
accountability, which requires clear justification for any restrictions on access. 
• 
Public information disclosure: affirming the right to access unprotected public information without legal 
repercussions. 
• 
Equality: ensuring non-discriminatory treatment of all information requests. 
The regulation also details the obligations of public entities, including the development of policies and procedures 
for handling information requests, the establishment of data management units, and the implementation of systems 
for verifying the identity of requesters. Entities must also document all information requests, manage fees for 
processing these requests, and maintain compliance with national laws. The request process involves submitting a 
formal application, with entities required to respond within specified timeframes, either by granting access, denying 
the request with justification, or extending the response time. 
 
DUE PROCESS AN D ACCOUNTABILITY 
DUE PROCESS AND ACCOUNTABILITY 
 
The Basic Law of Governance30 is the main law protecting due process rights in Saudi Arabia. Key provisions include: 
• 
The judiciary is an independent authority and judges' decisions are subject only to Islamic Sharia law. 
• 
All people, citizens or residents, are entitled to file suit on an equal basis. 
• 
Courts are empowered to arbitrate in all disputes and crimes. 
• 
The privacy of communications is inviolate and cannot be confiscated, delayed, surveilled or eavesdropped 
upon except as provided by law. 
 
While there is currently no specific policy for AI harm monitoring or remedies, such policies are under active 
consideration. The Personal Data Protection Law (PDPL) includes several articles aimed at monitoring data breaches 
in general. Additionally, the Personal Data Breach Incidents Procedural Guide was published to outline steps for 
controllers to follow if they become aware of any personal data breaches. In such cases, they are required to notify 
SDAIA and inform affected data subjects if the breach could compromise their data or impact their rights or 
interests. Furthermore, the Law of Civil Procedures provides guidelines for handling civil cases, including 
requirements for court clerks to attend hearings and maintain accurate records. The overarching Basic Law of 
Governance establishes the independence of the judiciary and guarantees the right to due process in Saudi Arabia. 
To strengthen these efforts, SDAIA’s AI Ethics Guidelines emphasise ethical considerations in AI development and 
deployment, supporting a proactive approach to responsible and secure AI use.

ONLINE SAFETY, INTEGRITY OF SPEECH, AND CYBERSECURITY 
 
 
Laws and Regulations 
The Anti-Cyber Crime Law31 of Saudi Arabia was first developed in 2009 and established a legal framework to 
combat cybercrimes by defining offences, assigning penalties, and enhancing information security. The law aims to 
protect public interest, morals, national security, and the economy by regulating the use of computers and 
information networks. The law outlines specific cybercrimes from minor offences (e.g., unauthorised access, 
defamation) to grave offences (e.g., unauthorised access to state security data) and provides for corresponding fines 
and/or prison sentences. The law ensures that cybercrime regulation does not conflict with other laws, such as those 
protecting intellectual property, and it mandates that the Communications and Information Technology Commission 
support investigations. The Bureau of Investigation and Public Prosecution is responsible for prosecuting offences 
under this law. However, the law does not address specific risks related to AI (e.g., misinformation/disinformation).  
Beyond the Anti-Cyber Crime Law, NCA has published a series of 17 regulatory documents32 which may be classified 
into 3 broad categories: 
• 
Policies and controls (e.g., Critical Systems Cybersecurity Controls, Operational Technology Cybersecurity 
Controls). 
• 
Frameworks and standards (e.g., The Saudi Cybersecurity Workforce Framework, The National 
Cryptographic Standards). 
• 
Guidelines and support tools (e.g., Cybersecurity Guidelines for e-Commerce, Cybersecurity Toolkits). 
 
KSA Performance in International Ranking 
Saudi Arabia has achieved a prominent position in Tier 1 of the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI), with a remarkable 
score range of 95–100. This ranking highlights Saudi Arabia’s deep commitment to cybersecurity and its role as a 
global leader in the field. By reaching this top tier, the Kingdom demonstrates its dedication to building a robust, 
secure, and resilient digital environment, setting an exemplary standard for cybersecurity practices. Saudi Arabia’s 
proactive and strategic approach to cyber resilience not only strengthens its national security but also reinforces its 
standing as a key player in the international cybersecurity landscape.

PUBLIC SECTOR CAPACITY 
 
 
Public Sector Upskilling 
To elevate public sector capabilities in AI, three strategic initiatives have been introduced under Vision 2030, driving 
innovation and efficiency. The first initiative established Data Management Offices (DMOs) across all government 
entities, with 3,838 employees trained through 216 specialised courses to advance AI adoption and research. The 
second focused on leadership, with the Government Leadership Development Programme providing 80 leaders in 
2024 with globally benchmarked training to implement data-driven strategies. The third initiative engaged 770 
participants in 569 workshops, fostering awareness and integration of AI across government operations. These 
efforts, aligned with the National Strategy for Data and Artificial Intelligence (NSDAI), are transforming Saudi Arabia’s 
public sector into a global leader in AI innovation. 
Public Sector AI Enablement 
In addition to upskilling of the public sector workforce, several initiatives developed within the SDAIA ecosystem act 
as enablers of public sector capacity in deploying AI: 
• 
Data Management Offices (DMOs) 
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has placed a high priority on data management, recognising it as an asset for 
investment and a critical driver of development, particularly within the AI sector. This vision was formally 
established in 2019 through a Royal Decree, which led to the creation of the National Data Management 
Office (NDMO) and mandated the establishment of data management offices across all government 
entities. 
Today, 245 Data Management Offices (DMOs) have been established, marking significant progress in 
implementing best practices and fostering enhanced compliance across government entities. These DMOs 
are empowered to develop strategies tailored to each entity's needs, ensuring alignment with national 
standards, and advancing the Kingdom’s strategic objectives in data management. 
• 
AI Offices 
Saudi Arabia has launched a national initiative to establish AI Offices in government agencies, aiming to 
leverage the transformative potential of artificial intelligence across the public sector. These offices are 
designed to ensure the ethical, safe, and responsible use of AI while raising awareness of its importance and 
applications, with a focus on adopting best practices and tools. 
In addition, they aim to foster collaboration through a unified framework that aligns efforts across entities, 
enhancing service quality and optimising resource use. Furthermore, the initiative, introduced in 2024, seeks 
to stimulate the development and adoption of AI-driven solutions to address challenges within government 
systems, reinforcing AI’s role as a catalyst for innovation and progress. 
• 
Estishraf 
A sector that provides future insights for decision-makers in the kingdom by providing interactive economic 
and social analytics and indicators in an online platform based on a national multi-disciplinary team by 
investing in big data, advanced analytical capabilities, and AI; to contribute to supporting the formulation of 
decisions, policy design, and simulation of the impact of various economic, social and demographic changes 
to support the future direction of achieving the Saudi vision 2030.

revolutionise government connectivity in KSA. This high-speed, modern network will serve as a backbone 
for interconnecting various government entities, enhancing their ability to collaborate and share information 
securely. Insofar as it increases the speed of inter-governmental data sharing, the SPINE initiative will further 
enable AI-use cases relying on secured and real-time data. 
• 
Deem Cloud initiative 
Established in 2018 through a Royal Decree, Deem Cloud serves as Saudi Arabia's government cloud 
computing platform, providing a robust and efficient technological infrastructure for government and semi-
government entities. By consolidating 237 data centres and delivering an estimated financial impact of 5.6 
billion SAR, the platform has become a cornerstone of the Kingdom’s digital transformation efforts. 
Deem Cloud also significantly advances environmental sustainability by reducing over 608,000 tons of 
carbon emissions and decreasing energy consumption by more than 64 megawatts. With its commitment to 
excellence, Deem Cloud has earned top-tier recognition from the Communications, Space, and Technology 
Commission (CST) and achieved globally respected certifications like ISO 27001 for Information Security and 
ISO 9001 for Quality Management, solidifying its role as a key enabler of the Saudi Vision 2030. 
• 
Nafath 
A national platform enabling unified and secure digital access to services across public and private sectors. 
By integrating advanced biometric authentication, it eliminates the need for multiple passwords and 
simplifies access for users. With over 17.2 million downloads and 380 million verification requests processed, 
Nafath plays a vital role in Saudi Arabia's digital transformation and aligns with Vision 2030's goals of a 
secure and efficient digital ecosystem.  
• 
National Data Bank (NDB) 
The NDB is a comprehensive ecosystem of interconnected platforms designed to accelerate data sharing, 
enhance data quality, and position data as a cornerstone of Saudi Arabia's digital economy. It integrates 
disparate national data assets into a unified repository through the National Data Lake, consolidating over 
85 TB of data from 60+ entities and 300+ systems. The Data Marketplace fosters transparency and 
innovation, offering 400+ APIs and enabling data exchange among 100+ entities. Collaborative efforts are

DIVERSITY, INCLUSION AND EQUALITY 
 
While KSA has improved in including women in the workforce, significant digital gender gaps remain, although 
dedicated programs and affirmative action is being developed. Beyond the gender gap, KSA is committed to 
improving connectivity, with dedicated programs aiming at reducing the rural/urban connectivity gap.  
 
The Gender Gap in KSA Is Improving in The Workforce, But Lags Digitally 
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has made significant progress in promoting diversity, particularly in the workforce. The 
labour force participation rate of Saudi women saw a remarkable increase from 20% in 2017 to 34% in 2022, 
representing a 71% improvement over five years. The Vision 2030 target, which aimed for a 30% female participation 
rate in the workforce by 2030, was therefore surpassed ahead of schedule.

Saudi Arabia has shown remarkable progress in fostering digital talent and promoting artificial intelligence 
innovation. One key achievement is the active empowerment of women within the technology and AI sectors, where 
their participation has now reached 35%. This milestone is part of a broader national effort to enhance digital 
inclusivity, equipping women with essential skills and creating opportunities for impactful contributions in high-tech 
fields. The focus on women's empowerment aligns with the Kingdom’s Vision 2030 goals, aiming for a diversified 
and inclusive digital economy. For instance, The Digital Gender Gaps ranking developed by the University of 
Oxford35 reports as: 
• 
Internet gender gap. 
• 
Combined both Online and Offline 0.763 
• 
ITU: 0.673 
 
• 
Mobile gender gap 
• 
Combined: 0.905 both online and offline. 
• 
GSMA: 0.965 
The gap between KSA and peers in ITU Internet Gender Gap suggests there is further room for improvement in 
female digital adoption. This gender gap is also visible in tertiary education within STEM programs, where 63.18% of 
graduates are male and only 36.82% are female36. Furthermore, there is a gender gap in career aspirations, with 
30% of top-performing male students in science or mathematics expecting to work as STEM professionals by the age 
of 30, compared to only 11.7% of female students. Affirmative action is well developed in KSA, and addresses equal 
opportunities for women through programmes such as: 
• 
Transport Support (Wusool)37: A national initiative by the Human Resources Development Fund (HRDF) 
aimed at empowering women in the private sector by addressing transportation challenges and enhancing 
career stability for female employees.   
• 
Support for Children's Hospitality (Qurrah)38: An HRDF programme designed to empower working women 
by providing access to childcare support services, fostering greater workforce participation and promoting a 
more inclusive labour market. 
Affirmative Action in The Data and AI Space 
Saudi Arabia has launched several targeted initiatives to enhance the participation and qualifications of women and 
other vulnerable groups in the digital and AI sectors. These efforts are part of the Kingdom's broader commitment 
to inclusivity and empowerment:   
• 
Women Empowerment in Technology39: 
• 
The Ministry of Communication and Information Technology (MCIT) launched the Women 
Empowerment Programme in Technology40 in 2018 to enhance women’s digital skills and create 
opportunities in the ICT sector. The female representation in the industry jumped to 35% in 2024, up 
from 7% in 2018.

• 
This initiative received global recognition, winning a world award from ITU (WSIS) in 2020 for its impact 
in empowering women in Communications and Information Technology41. 
 
• 
AI Training and Capacity Building: 
• 
In 2023, SDAIA introduced the Elevate Program42, aiming to train 25,000 women in Saudi Arabia and 
globally in advanced AI-related technical fields. 
• 
Additional initiatives such as the Saudi Digital Academy, the Future Skills Programme, the SDAIA 
Academy, and the Tuwaiq Academy extend support to women and other underserved populations43, 
equipping them with essential skills in digital and AI fields. 
 
• 
Accessibility for People of Determination: Saudi Arabia mandates all government agencies and service 
providers to comply with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 AAA standards. These 
standards ensure that online content is accessible and user-friendly for People with Disabilities:   
• 
Features include variable font sizes for the visually impaired, contrast colours for colour blindness, 
alternative text for images, and compatibility with assistive devices like screen readers and braille 
translators. 
• 
This accessibility commitment ensures equal opportunities for People with Disabilities to engage with 
government services and digital content44. 
While these initiatives are expected to have a significant impact on the Saudi workforce, managing their performance 
is made difficult by the lack of diversity statistics reporting in the data and AI space. For instance, there is no legal 
requirement for tech companies to publish diversity statistics, and there is no provision for employment of women or 
other vulnerable populations in the field of data and AI within the KSA labour laws, as mentioned in the previous 
section. 
Beyond the Gender Gap 
While efforts are well underway to tackle gender equality, the Kingdom has made strides in bridging the rural-urban 
connectivity divide, with 99% of its population now covered by 4G wireless broadband45. For instance, The Schools 
Connectivity project is a part of a large nationwide connectivity project for the Ministry of Education. The aim is to 
connect more than 3,000 remote schools with no Internet service, use satellite VSAT, and enhance and upgrade the 
available connectivity in more than 19,000 schools. This project is strategic and extremely important in ensuring that 
all schools in Saudi Arabia are linked to the ministry via the Internet, thereby enabling them to access and use the 
services provided by the ministry’s major centralised systems FARIS, NOOR and EduMap Award.46 In addition, KSA’s 
official language is only Arabic but there are many Arabic dialects, therefore online content and data are available 
from different resources to train AI model in Arabic language to be more inclusive. For example, SDAIA published 
3,000 hours of voice from different Arabic dialects with annotated data for AI training. Arabic language still 
underrepresented in many large training datasets due to the lack of available public datasets.

Increased Demand for AI Talent 
Over recent years, Saudi Arabia AI workforce has expanded rapidly, reflecting the rising demand for AI skills across 
various sectors. As of 2022, the number of AI specialists in Saudi Arabia has reached 1.4K+ based on their job title, 
with a broader pool of 165K+ workers having at least two related AI skills99. While these numbers are based on 
LinkedIn data and are therefore subject to the signalling effect of employers and potential employees alike, they 
nevertheless reflect a fundamental increase in the need for AI talent in the Kingdom. 
The acknowledgement of the positive response of KSA’s education system to the labour market’s increased demand 
for AI talent is also reinforced through the metric for the concentration of AI talent in KSA. As evidenced by numbers 
from the OECD. AI policy observatory based on a LinkedIn analysis (percentage of LinkedIn members with AI skills or 
who perform an AI occupation (e.g., machine learning engineer), there is an ongoing structural shift within the KSA 
workforce, adapting to the requirement of skills in AI.

INVESTMENTS AND OUTPUT  
The global race for AI supremacy is accelerating, with many countries striving to meet ambitious goals. While some 
may lag, focused investments in AI in areas like research and innovation, talent development, and infrastructure can 
transition nearly any country to the forefront. Saudi Arabia exemplifies this potential transformation. With $42+ 
billion (approximately SAR 157.67 billion) in active investments—in digital, telecommunications, and information 
technology sectors—the country continues to lead as the largest digital market in the MENA region. This 
commitment was further showcased at LEAP 2023, where Saudi Arabia's tech sector attracted an additional $9.5 
billion (approximately SAR 35.66 billion), marking a significant milestone for the industry. While these figures account 
for sharp increases in government investments over the period, private investment in the KSA AI sector has also 
increased significantly.101 
Government Investment 
Government AI spending is crucial to driving innovation, economic growth, and improving public services. It also 
leads to building essential infrastructure, supporting education and research, and encouraging private sector 
involvement, ultimately positioning the nation for success in the global tech landscape. In KSA, the government has 
significantly increased its technology investments in recent years. While AI spending figures are not reported 
separately, they are included within the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) spending, which grew 
43% yearly on average between 2019 and 2023.

INFRASTRUCTURE AND CONNECTIVITY  
Infrastructure 
Saudi Arabia recognises that robust infrastructure is crucial for the development, implementation, and deployment of 
AI. To build such infrastructure, the country focuses on three key pillars:  
• 
Data centre capacity 
• 
Advanced supercomputing capabilities 
• 
Scalable cloud computing services.  
These elements work in concert to create an ecosystem capable of supporting complex AI applications, from smart 
city initiatives to groundbreaking research in fields like healthcare and energy. Various entities are driving efforts to 
develop robust infrastructure by collaborating with global tech providers such as NVIDIA and IBM 
Entities like SDAIA and KAUST are leading these infrastructure efforts in the public sector. In the private sector, 
companies such as STC and Saudi Aramco are making significant strides by heavily investing in AI infrastructure. For 
instance, in 2022, From a pure infrastructure perspective, STC has also deployed an AI-powered operations system 
on its network using Nokia’s MantaRay118 Self-Organising Network (SON). This AI-powered system automates 
network optimisation, resulting in an increased utilisation rate of approximately 30% on loaded cells and a 10% 
average improvement in user throughput. Similarly, through its subsidiary Aramco Digital, Aramco formed a strategic 
partnership with Worldwide Technology (WWT) in July 2024 to advance AI infrastructure in Saudi Arabia119. 
Despite these ongoing efforts, a SDAIA survey shows that only 28% of government entities believe they have 
adequate AI infrastructure in place. Likewise, Cisco's AI Readiness Index indicates that just 22% of private sector 
businesses in Saudi Arabia possess highly scalable infrastructure for the development of AI use cases. This highlights 
that the full impact of these initiatives has yet to materialise.

Cloud Computing 
After launching the Cloud Computing Regulatory Framework131 (CCRF) in 2018 to encourage cloud investment while 
protecting consumers, the Saudi government, led by the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology 
(MCIT), unveiled a plan in 2021 to attract $18 billion worth of investment by 2030132. These efforts aim to lay the 
foundation for accelerated cloud adoption, attract international investments, and foster the development of local 
talent and innovation within the cloud sector. 
As of 2023, the Kingdom has successfully increased the number of Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) registered with the 
Communications, Space & Technology Commission (CST) to 29. Global tech giants such as Oracle, Google Cloud, 
Alibaba Cloud, and SAP are establishing cloud regions in the country through strategic joint ventures with local 
telecommunication companies, resellers, and other relevant partners. Simultaneously, local providers such as STC, 
SITE, and Cloud4C are playing a key role in strengthening the domestic cloud ecosystem 
In a similar vein, SDAIA launched DEEM, a government cloud platform, in 2018. It offers secure, reliable, and scalable 
cloud services for government and semi-government entities. Notable achievements include the consolidation of 
over 248 data centres, the provision of services to 185 government entities, the delivery of 51 different cloud services, 
and generating a financial impact of approximately $1.5 billion (SAR 5.6 billion) through hosted services. 
 
During the 8th Future Investment Initiative (FII) held in Riyadh, the Public Investment Fund (PIF) announced a 
strategic partnership with Google Cloud to establish an advanced AI and Cloud Computing Hub in Saudi Arabia. This 
initiative underscores the Kingdom's commitment to advancing its technological infrastructure.133

The conjunction of these efforts has already led to significant developments. For instance, the Ministry of Health 
(MOH) leveraged cloud platforms to develop a chatbot hosted on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure during the COVID-19 
pandemic, and the King Abdullah International Medical Research Center (KAIMRC) uses cloud-based high-
performance computing to power research into treatments for infectious diseases134.

DEVELOPING A NATIONAL AI MULTI-
STAKEHOLDER ROADMAP 
OVERVIEW OF  STAKEHOLDER EN GAGEMENT PROCESS  
OVERVIEW OF STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT PROCESS  
SDAIA has engaged heavily with stakeholders in the data and AI landscape, both in KSA and globally, to inform its 
policy development and activities. This multi-stakeholder engagement covers the government and public sector, 
academic and research institutions, the private sector, relevant NGOs and intergovernmental organisations, and civil 
society. These interactions are particularly frequent in the context of punctual policy development, as shown by the 
engagement process rolled-out for the development of the National Strategy of Data & AI (NSDAI) in 2020 (e.g., 
alignments with 25+ key government entities, workshops with 100+ entities from various sectors). 
However, this stakeholder engagement takes place on a continuous basis and through a variety of formats, all of 
which form a core part of SDAIA’s activities: 
• 
Regular workshops (e.g., Regional AI Governance Workshop). 
• 
Public consultations and surveys (e.g., public sector AI-adoption survey). 
• 
Partnerships with industry and academia (e.g., partnerships with IBM, KAUST). 
• 
Advisory committees and working groups (e.g., United Nations AI Advisory Board). 
• 
Conferences and relevant forums (e.g., GAIN summit). 
For instance, following the development of NSDAI in 2020, a wealth of interactions with the local and global data 
and AI ecosystem have taken place: 
• 
Experts from 10+ countries engaged. 
• 
80+ government entities surveyed. 
• 
30+ direct meetings with government entities held. 
• 
50+ Chief Data Officers surveyed. 
• 
1,000+ digital engagements held. 
• 
7+ conferences and summits held.

### Page 66

66 
In addition, throughout 2024, entities from the full spectrum of stakeholders have been involved in consultation 
efforts through multiple workshops and assemblies. SDAIA seized the opportunity of 10 of these gatherings to 
finetune strategic directions for AI in the Kingdom, and to investigate possible supporting initiatives: 
•

MAIN CHALLEN GES IDENTIFIED THROUGH PREVIOUS CONSULTATIONS  
MAIN CHALLENGES IDENTIFIED THROUGH PREVIOUS CONSULTATIONS 
 
Through the consultations held with ecosystem players in the Kingdom and globally, several challenges and 
opportunities have been identified across the KSA data and AI ecosystem: 
• 
Laws and regulation: 
Challenges: While the Kingdom's regulatory framework for AI is still evolving, it may be enhanced to foster a 
supportive environment for testing and deploying AI technologies which account for sector specificities: 
• 
Implementation and compliance of existing regulations are still perceived as a challenge by the public 
sector, in particular due to the lack of clarity on how they impact actual operations. 
• 
From a private sector point of view, regulation might hinder innovation and could be an obstacle to the 
successful scaling of AI systems.  
Opportunities: The enhancement of the Data and Privacy Regulatory Sandbox represents a strategic 
opportunity to refine AI applications within a controlled environment: 
• 
From a public sector standpoint, real-time policy iterations and improvements are facilitated based on 
empirical data, leading to fit-for-purpose policies which also account for sector specificities. 
• 
In addition, key learnings from sandbox experimentation may be synthesised and serve as a guidebook 
for the whole data and AI ecosystem, providing guidance and support to public sector entities in the 
implementation and compliance with emerging regulation. 
• 
Finally, while benefiting from a loosened regulatory context in which to investigate scaling of systems 
more rapidly, the private sector would also be more involved in setting the KSA AI agenda, mitigating 
existing perceptions of being kept out of the loop.

• 
Capacity building: 
Challenges: There is a broad consensus across both the public and private sector today that Saudi Arabia 
faces a critical scarcity of high-quality and internationally competitive AI talent. This talent gap risks slowing 
the pace of AI innovation and broader technological adoption across industries: 
• 
While the talent gap is generalised and applies to the private sector at large, hiring talent is particularly 
difficult for SMEs and startups as larger corporations remain more attractive to data & AI talents. The 
talent gap suffered by the private sector should be largely targeted by improvements to the KSA 
education system at large, and through increased attractivity for foreign talent. 
• 
In the public sector, implementation of AI-tools and use-cases are still lagging yet are expected to rely 
more heavily on appropriate continuous learning opportunities as a key factor of success. The 
challenges faces are therefore more related to general AI-upskilling of the public-sector workforce, 
which could be further improved from its current state. 
Opportunities: 
• 
To fuel the private sector with AI talent, inclusion of data science and AI in school programmes and 
universities is well underway and may be further strengthened. Increasing the attractivity of KSA 
universities for foreign talent is also expected to play a role in the nurturing of a Saudi-based talent 
pool (e.g., through international collaborations and exchange programmes). 
• 
Beyond the growth of talent locally to fuel the private sector, increasing the attractivity of KSA at large 
to existing AI-talent is also perceived as critical to bridge the talent gap, with the added benefit of 
bringing international perspectives and expertise to the Kingdom. Levers for increased attractivity 
should be viewed beyond the pure AI-lens and fit into a broader logic of attraction of foreign talent, 
across different sectors and fields of expertise. 
• 
From a public sector point of view, the willingness and ability of employees to embrace data and AI use 
cases could also be improved through adapted and evolving training programmes. When deployed 
through the right providers, these training programmes are also expected to increase ties and foster 
cross-pollination of ideas with leading private sector organisations. More anecdotally, these enhanced 
continuous learning opportunities would also serve the purpose of identifying AI talent and enthusiasts 
within public sector organisations, to whom more advanced and costly training opportunities may be 
considered.  
• 
Responsible technologies and innovation: 
Challenges: The KSA AI ecosystem today lacks maturity and is characterised by a limited number of AI 
startups and established AI companies. In this context, limited government enablement is viewed as the 
main challenge: 
• 
From the research ecosystem’s point of view, existing support mechanisms are viewed as not focusing 
sufficiently on generating impact, leading to limited innovation in spite of funds and lack of translation 
of fundamental research into concrete applications.

### Page 69

69 
• 
For startups and SMEs, beyond the possibility of government funding, the absence of a strong 
government impetus to create a cohesive ecosystem is highlighted as a main challenge (e.g., 
opportunities for data monetisation, networking opportunities, sponsored attendance to events, 
competitions). 
• 
Thirdly, and from an infrastructure angle covering both the private and public sector, computing and 
cloud capabilities could be further enhanced, to foster further development and deployment of 
advanced AI applications. 
• 
Finally, the environmental impact of the growth of the KSA AI ecosystem is not sufficiently accounted 
for, be it in theory or in practice. For instance, sustainability practices in AI infrastructure development in 
Saudi Arabia are not developed, despite being included in SDAIA's AI Ethics Principles.  
Opportunities: 
• 
Firstly, enhancing and promoting public-private partnerships aimed at addressing real-world industrial 
challenges could catalyse the practical application of AI research. This could in turn drive both 
technological and economic progress, while transforming the ecosystem into a more innovative and 
cohesive universe. 
• 
Secondly, from an infrastructure standpoint, Saudi Arabia is currently lagging in terms of computing 
capabilities, there is strong momentum in the development of next-generation AI infrastructure (i.e., 
advanced data centres and enhanced cloud computing capabilities). These efforts provide existing 
momentum to be further leveraged. 
• 
Finally, sustainability practices are at a nascent stage on the global stage, providing the Kingdom with 
the opportunity to position itself as a pioneer. This positioning should be viewed in the context of a 
substantial renewable energy infrastructure roll-out across the Kingdom.  
• 
Institutional frameworks and governance: 
Challenges: There is currently a limited view within the public sector of the efficiency of previously 
implemented policies, limiting the possibility of agile amendments. More generally, the National Strategy for 
Data and AI (NSDAI) was developed in 2020 and should be updated to incorporate latest thinking and 
outcomes of stakeholder engagement in the rapidly moving AI field. 
Opportunities: 
• 
Stakeholder engagement has been conducted on a regular basis since the development of the NSDAI, 
and input from the ecosystem is regularly consolidated through exercises like the RAM report. This 
means the data exists but needs to be analysed on a more continuous basis through an adapted data 
backbone. 
• 
It is therefore notable that from a policy monitoring point of view, the National Data Bank (NDB) offers 
an existing platform which may host relevant KPIs, tracking policy efficiency across the Kingdom.

### Page 70

70 
• 
Inclusion and well-being: 
Challenges: A significant gender gap exists within the KSA data and AI ecosystem today, particularly visible 
through the quasi-absence of female role models in the field. It is critical to ensure this gap is closed in the 
broader context of the AI-talent gap in KSA. In the current state, several more detailed observations can be 
made: 
• 
Firstly, aspirations of female students in KSA are not geared towards STEM at large. 
• 
In addition, while several digital programmes targeting women are deployed, their efficiency is not 
sufficiently tracked and verified. 
Opportunities: Programmes for female empowerment in the digital sphere exist, and may be enhanced to 
improve the outcomes of young women in STEM fields: 
• 
Existing programmes for the creation of early AI-aspirations across girls may be further enhanced, and 
further programs should be developed. 
• 
Across the board, if properly managed for outcomes, these programmes can help solve the AI gender 
gap, and in turn the KSA AI-talent gap. 
• 
Investment ecosystem: 
Challenges: The AI startup scene in Saudi Arabia is growing slowly, with a limited number of local AI startups 
emerging. Startups often face difficulties in receiving the necessary guidance and support from capital 
investors, which hampers their ability to scale and grow. This indicates a lack of cohesion and maturity in the 
KSA AI investment ecosystem, particularly when it comes to fostering early-stage AI companies, echoing the 
lack of effective government enablement in technology development and innovation. 
Opportunities: There is potential to leverage the existing deployment of government and Saudi Venture 
Capital (VC) funds to better support the growth and development of local AI startups. Saudi-based VC 
funds have been actively investing internationally, which presents an opportunity to leverage their global 
expertise and experiences to strengthen the domestic AI ecosystem: 
• 
The Kingdom could therefore accelerate the growth of its AI startup landscape by multiplying 
touchpoints between investors with international experience and startups, at all stages of development. 
• 
As the KSA AI ecosystem matures, deploying the necessary incentives to attract additional foreign VC 
firms into the Kingdom will further ensure international best practice gets a stronger foothold.

CONCLUSION  
In light of the challenges and opportunities identified across the 6 dimensions, 10 key conclusions may be drawn. 
Summarising the input of all engaged stakeholders, these conclusions represent key foundations to be accounted for 
in the development of high-level recommendations on the path towards a new national strategy for data and AI: 
1. 
Saudi Arabia's has a unique data and AI authority that led the kingdom data & AI strategy, policymaking, 
regulation, and enablement. However, governance framework is still under development, which presents 
unique opportunities for shaping a robust regulatory environment. As governance structures evolve, there is 
potential to establish Saudi Arabia as a leader in AI ethics and compliance, drawing on global best practices 
to ensure that AI development benefits all segments of society. 
2. 
The establishment of AI-specific regulatory sandboxes could accelerate innovation while managing risks. 
Such environments allow for the testing and refinement of AI technologies under regulatory supervision, 
providing valuable insights into effective governance mechanisms tailored to relevant sectors. 
3. 
There is a critical need to address the talent gap in the AI sector to sustain growth and innovation. While 
Saudi Arabia is making strides in educational reform to boost AI and data science skills, more targeted 
initiatives are required to attract and retain high-quality, internationally competitive talent. In addition, 
upskilling of the public sector through adequate training is critical. 
4. Educational systems must continue to adapt to prepare future generations for a world increasingly driven by 
AI. This involves not only integrating AI into curricula but also ensuring that ethical considerations and 
human-centric design principles are emphasised to students, while monitoring the quality of students’ hard 
skills. 
5. 
Addressing the talent gap relies on empowering women to pursue careers in STEM fields, through early 
nurturing and appropriate inclusion programmes further down the road. 
6. 
The maturity of the AI ecosystem in Saudi Arabia is a pivotal factor in its ability to compete on a global 
scale. Strengthening the ecosystem with a focus on nurturing local startups while attracting established AI 
companies will be crucial to driving innovation and maintaining technological leadership. This may be done 
by ensuring ecosystem-wide learning effects from KSA investments in startups abroad. 
7. 
While improvements have been made to AI infrastructure, it is critical that momentum is kept ensuring 
unhindered development of the KSA AI ecosystem. 
8. 
Sustainability must be a cornerstone of AI infrastructure development to ensure long-term viability. 
Developing guidelines and practices for sustainable AI can help mitigate environmental impacts and align 
with global efforts to promote responsible technology use while putting KSA on the map as a thought 
leader in sustainable AI. 
9. 
The strategic deployment of government support and funding can catalyse the growth of the AI sector 
locally. Initiatives should be tailored to enhance the resources available to AI startups and research 
institutions, fostering a vibrant technological environment attracting leaders in the field, and aiming at tightly 
knit and cohesive ecosystem. 
10. As a general principle, cross-pollination of ideas between the private and the public sector, and between 
international and local players should be sought as a critical objective on all fronts.

TOWARDS A NATIONAL AI 
STRATEGY: HIGH LEVEL 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
Saudi Arabia's National Strategy for Data and AI (NSDAI), launched in 2020, outlines the Kingdom's ambition to 
become a global leader in AI by 2030 and beyond. As part of this journey, Saudi Arabia has engaged extensively 
with stakeholders through workshops, public consultations, strategic partnerships, and advisory committees. The 
application of the Readiness Assessment Methodology (RAM) has further informed Saudi Arabia's AI strategy by 
providing valuable insights into current strengths and areas for improvement. 
This section provides targeted recommendations for Saudi Arabia across six key dimensions: laws and regulation, 
institutional frameworks and governance, capacity building, responsible technologies and innovation, inclusion and 
well-being, and investment ecosystem. These recommendations are designed to ensure that Saudi Arabia's AI 
ecosystem remains robust, forward-looking, and aligned with the Kingdom’s values, including a shared commitment 
to ethical and sustainable AI development as reflected in UNESCO’s principles. 
 
LAWS AN D REGULATION  
LAWS AND REGULATION  
The laws and regulation dimension provides key recommendations designed to address the specific regulatory 
needs of Saudi Arabia’s rapidly evolving AI ecosystem. As the Kingdom advances in AI, it is crucial to develop clear, 
sector-specific legislation, establish regulatory sandboxes, and enhance data access policies to ensure that AI 
technologies are deployed securely, ethically, and in alignment with both national and global standards. 
 
DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT AI STANDARDS FOR PRIORITY SECTORS 
 
As AI continues to shape various industries, the need for tailored legislation has become increasingly important to 
address specific requirements and challenges. While Saudi Arabia’s AI Ethics Principles provide a strong foundation 
for responsible AI adoption, developing AI-specific legislation and sector-oriented standards would further support 
safe and effective implementation in key fields such as healthcare, finance, and transportation. 
 
Introducing comprehensive AI-specific legislation, alongside sector-specific standards, would help provide clarity and 
guidance for stakeholders, ensuring ethical and accountable AI practices. This approach would also promote 
innovation and align the Kingdom with global best practices, reinforcing its leadership in the responsible use of AI 
technologies. 
 
Timeline: 2025-2030 
Priority: High

### Page 73

73 
IMPLEMENT SPECILAIZED AI REGULATORY SANDBOXES AND PILOT ZONES 
 
As AI technologies advance, a dynamic and adaptable regulatory environment is essential to foster innovation while 
maintaining safety and ethical standards. Regulatory sandboxes and pilot zones provide controlled environments 
where AI solutions can be tested, refined, and prepared for market deployment. 
 
Saudi Arabia has already seen success with initiatives launched by the Communications, Space & Technology 
Commission (CST) and the National Data Management Office (NDMO). Building on these achievements, it is 
proposed that specialised AI sandboxes be developed for priority sectors. These sandboxes would help balance 
technological advancement with safeguards for responsible AI development. 
 
Key actions include identifying priority sectors, setting clear objectives and participation criteria, and establishing 
comprehensive operating models with strong oversight. Additionally, leveraging existing pilot zones as testbeds for 
AI solutions would enhance practical experimentation and refinement in real-world environments, further supporting 
the Kingdom’s leadership in responsible AI innovation. 
 
Timeline: 2025-2026 
Priority: High 
 
INTRODUCE AI-SPECIFIC TERMS AND CONDITIONS IN PUBLIC PROCUREMENT 
Given the potential risks of biased algorithms and security vulnerabilities, governments must establish clear policies 
to regulate the procurement of AI systems and AI-integrated products and services. At present, Saudi Arabia lacks 
specific laws or policies governing AI-related procurement. However, they have adopted AI Ethics Principles that 
require AI system owners to ensure that AI Ethics due diligence is carried out for third-party AI systems. A formal list 
of certified vendors with AI-related provisions has yet to be established, although a voluntary digital badges 
programme for AI compliance is currently under development. 
To align with international best practices and enhance the robustness of AI system procurement, it is recommended 
that Saudi Arabia develops comprehensive procurement policies that incorporate AI-specific requirements, ethical 
standards, and cybersecurity provisions. 
Timeline: 2025-2030 
Priority: High 
 
 
EXPAND THE SCOPE OF AI ETHICS ASSESSMENT ACROSS PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS 
 
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has demonstrated commendable progress by publishing comprehensive AI Ethics 
Principles, providing a robust framework to guide the ethical development and deployment of AI systems. However, 
ensuring systematic compliance with these principles across public and private sectors remains a critical area for 
development. While many entities have begun aligning their operations with these guidelines, the absence of 
standardised compliance mechanisms and monitoring frameworks poses challenges to consistent implementation. 
 
To address this, it is recommended that Saudi Arabia strengthens efforts to institutionalize adherence to its AI Ethics 
Principles. This can be achieved through the establishment of sector-specific compliance frameworks, the 
introduction of regular auditing and monitoring processes, and the development of capacity-building programs to 
ensure stakeholders are well-equipped to meet ethical standards. Such measures will enhance the Kingdom’s AI 
readiness and position it as a global leader in fostering ethical AI practices. 
 
Timeline: 2025-2030 
Priority: Medium

### Page 74

ENHANCE REGULATIONS AROUND SYNTHETIC CONTENT GENERATION 
 
Saudi Arabia has made notable strides in addressing the complexities of synthetic content generation, such as 
deepfakes and AI-created media. However, the absence of a formalized mechanism for the regular oversight and 
refinement of policies and guidelines presents a critical challenge. As AI technologies in this domain continue to 
evolve rapidly, this gap could hinder the Kingdom’s ability to effectively address emerging risks, including misuse, 
misinformation, and ethical concerns. 
 
To ensure the robustness and adaptability of its regulatory framework, it is recommended that Saudi Arabia 
establishes a structured mechanism for the ongoing review and enhancement of synthetic content policies. This 
mechanism should incorporate continuous monitoring of technological advancements, active stakeholder 
engagement, and alignment with international best practices. By adopting this approach, the Kingdom can 
safeguard against potential risks while fostering innovation in synthetic content generation in a responsible and 
ethical manner. 
 
Timeline: 2025-2028 
Priority: High 
 
INSTITUTIONAL  FRAMEWORKS AND GOVERN ANCE  
INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORKS AND GOVERNANCE 
 
The institutional frameworks and governance dimension provide key recommendations to ensure the effective 
implementation and oversight of AI initiatives in Saudi Arabia. By establishing mechanisms to monitor AI 
programmes, regularly reviewing the National Strategy for Data and AI, and improving data sharing practices, the 
Kingdom can ensure that its AI initiatives are aligned with national goals, responsive to new challenges, and 
governed ethically. 
 
REFRESH THE NATIONAL AI STRATEGY TO MEET EVOLOVING PRIORETIES 
 
Saudi Arabia’s national AI strategy has provided a strong foundation for fostering innovation and advancing AI 
adoption across key sectors. However, with rapid technological advancements and shifting national priorities, it is
