      "text": "While India has taken a measured approach to AI governance, so far, the increasing integration of AI \nacross sectors brings a growing range of complex risks, spanning technical failures, ethical concerns, \nsocietal harms, legal ambiguities, economic disruptions, environmental costs and national security \nthreats. Without a standardized framework to identify, classify and assess these risks, governance \nefforts may become fragmented and inconsistent. \nDuring consultations, stakeholders highlighted that a lack of research on AI risks and the absence of \na common taxonomy on harms may result in fragmented regulation, overlaps and gaps in oversight, \nand inconsistent treatment of similar risks. To address this, it is recommended that India conduct a \ncomprehensive AI risk-mapping exercise and develop a shared risk/harm taxonomy. Further, a gap \nanalysis of existing legal frameworks may also be taken up, as suggested in the short-term action \nplan of the AI Governance Guidelines.417 These steps will clarify the scope and severity of AI-related \nrisks, and help ensure more consistent, proportionate and adaptable regulatory responses across \nsectors.\nRATIONALE\nIndia’s AI Safety Institute may undertake a comprehensive AI risk-mapping and \ntaxonomy development exercise\nThe AI Safety Institute (AISI), in consultation with both the AI governance group and the \ntechnology and policy expert committee proposed under the AI Governance Guidelines, may \ninitiate a coordinated, cross-sectoral study to map and assess emerging and existing AI-related \nrisks.

Without practical tools or guidance, developers \nand deployers often struggle to integrate these principles into design and implementation life cycles.\nRecognizing these challenges, India has already begun supporting the development of practical, \ntechno-legal solutions through initiatives under the IndiaAI Mission. Under the Safe & Trusted \nAI pillar, the government has issued two expressions of interest (EOIs) to develop tools, frameworks \nand self-assessment mechanisms tailored to India’s institutional and developmental context. \nThe establishment of the IndiaAI Safety Institute further advances this objective, serving as the \nnational anchor institution for guiding responsible AI development and helping convert ethical \nprinciples into operational practices across sectors. Building on these initiatives, India may continue \nto expand and institutionalize such tools to ensure that practical, implementable mechanisms for \nethical AI become widely accessible across the ecosystem.\nRATIONALE\nThe AI Safety Institute, in collaboration with private entities, may establish \na voluntary repository of ethical AI practices \nThe AI Safety Institute (AISI), under the IndiaAI Mission, may establish a dynamic, publicly \naccessible repository of existing practices for operationalizing and contextualizing ethical \nprinciples according to India’s needs. In doing so, the AISI may be empowered to conduct \nresearch, analysis and testing, collaborate with international bodies, support industry \ncompliance and contribute to the development of standards. This platform can enable \ngovernments, AI developers/companies and researchers to voluntarily contribute their existing \nethical AI practices. The repository can include both sector-agnostic",

Under India’s Constitution, legislative powers are distributed \nbetween the centre and the states through three lists: the Union List, the State List, and the Concurrent \nList. Each branch plays an important role in shaping the trajectory of AI in India.\nThe Union List includes subjects on which only the Union Legislature may make laws, such as telegraphs, \ntelephones, wireless, and broadcasting. The State List includes matters where states exercise exclusive \nauthority, such as police, public health, law and order, and education. The Concurrent List allows both \nthe centre and the states to legislate on subjects such as criminal law and insolvency, with central law \nprevailing in case of conflict. This federal design ensures that policy-making reflects India’s diversity: \nstates have both the power and the obligation to adapt national frameworks to local conditions, \nmaking governance inherently contextual and negotiated. \nParliament \nThe Indian Parliament remains central to the lawmaking process, with the power to debate and pass \nbills introduced by the executive. Additionally, members of parliament regularly exercise oversight \nby raising questions or interventions related to AI policies, ethics and safety, investments, global \ncooperation, and regulatory approaches, and by introducing private member bills.3 Parliamentary \ncommittees play a key role in examining government action – particularly the Standing Committee \non Communications and Information Technology,4 which has selected, among other subjects, the \n‘Impact of emergence of Artificial Intelligence and related issues’ for examination.\nThe executive\nThe President of India is the constitutional head of the executive at the union level.

In addition, the public \nsector needs to strengthen its ability to procure, govern and deploy AI responsibly, considering the \ngrowing emphasis on AI governance and AI-powered public service delivery. \nThere is also a need to shift focus from AI fluency to AI competence, to improve employability and \nalign with market expectations.
