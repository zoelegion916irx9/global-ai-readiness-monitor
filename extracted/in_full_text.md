## Recommendations

### Recommendation 1: evidence-based risk and legal review
While India has taken a measured approach to AI governance, so far, the increasing integration of AI 
across sectors brings a growing range of complex risks, spanning technical failures, ethical concerns, 
societal harms, legal ambiguities, economic disruptions, environmental costs and national security 
threats. Without a standardized framework to identify, classify and assess these risks, governance 
efforts may become fragmented and inconsistent. 
During consultations, stakeholders highlighte

### Recommendation 2: AI developers and deployers
During consultations, stakeholders highlighted that translating high-level ethical AI principles 
such as fairness, accountability, transparency and safety into actionable AI practices remains a key 
barrier to ethical and effective deployment of AI. Without practical tools or guidance, developers 
and deployers often struggle to integrate these principles into design and implementation life cycles.
Recognizing these challenges, India has already begun supporting the development of practical,

CHAPTER 1 
Diagnosis of the national AI landscape
AI governance in India: an overview of legal structure, policies and institutions
India has a quasi-federal structure. Under India’s Constitution, legislative powers are distributed 
between the centre and the states through three lists: the Union List, the State List, and the Concurrent 
List. Each branch plays an important role in shaping the trajectory of AI in India.
The Union List includes subjects on which only the Union Legislature may m

### Recommendation 5: Advance public trust in AI through governance, procurement
While the benefits of AI are increasingly visible across sectors in India, concerns around its risks and 
potential harms have also led to trust issues, especially in a context of unequal digital literacy. While 
data indicated optimism around the usage of AI, stakeholder consultations highlighted that public 
trust may be weakened by the lack of better understanding of how AI systems work, how personal 
data is used, and what safeguards exist for users. This uncertainty often leads to confusion

### Recommendation 6: embedding ethics and supporting inclusive transitions
The RAM consultations highlighted that while India is making strong strides in AI skilling, key 
challenges persist. Skills gaps, job displacement risks and a shortage of qualified AI educators remain 
key concerns. Many mid-career professionals lack clear upskilling pathways, while informal workers 
and those outside metro cities face limited access to quality AI education. In addition, the public 
sector needs to strengthen its ability to procure, govern and deploy AI responsibly, considering

### Recommendation 7: into AI infrastructure planning and deployment
As India scales up AI adoption, there is a critical need to address environmental sustainability. 
The rising environmental footprint of large-scale AI systems, including data centres and compute 
clusters, requires that sustainability be embedded into infrastructure planning from the outset. This 
includes integrating clean energy solutions, encouraging the use of energy-efficient AI models and 
developing regulatory mechanisms to assess environmental impact.
To ensure long-term equity and resi

### Recommendation 8: AI workforce and research and development ecosystem
India’s AI ecosystem must be inclusive by design. Currently, the representation of women, rural 
populations and marginalized communities remains limited across AI research, education and the 
workforce. This under-representation risks embedding bias not only in datasets and algorithms, but 
in the direction of innovation itself. Promoting diversity is a matter of equity along with producing 
more representative and responsible AI outcomes.

Foreword
We have officially entered the Age of Artificial Intelligence. 
The world is now set to change at a pace not seen in decades, 
even centuries. AI-based tools and applications make our lives 
easier, smoother and richer. They help us move efficiently, get 
informed, get credit, get a job, or get our taxes done.
But in its current form, AI reproduces and amplifies many of the 
social challenges we face. It is not acceptable that around a third 
of the world’s population still lacks adequate internet access. 
Upstream, the AI industry is highly concentrated, with just a 
few countries and a dozen companies accounting for a major 
share of the sector. This can only lead to greater inequality of 
outcomes – including gender disparities – downstream. Non-
diverse AI teams, unrepresentative datasets, and opaque and biased algorithms can cause harm, 
particularly to those who are already vulnerable, whether companies or individuals, children and 
young people, women or entire democracies.
That is why UNESCO drafted the Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, which was 
adopted by 193 countries in 2021, to make sure AI delivers fair, sustainable and inclusive outcomes. 
The Recommendation is based on the protection and promotion of human rights, human dignity 
and environmental sustainability, and these values are then translated into principles such as 
accountability, transparency and privacy. The Recommendation also sets out concrete policy actions 
that governments can draw on to steer technological developments in a responsible direction, 
premised on the belief that light-touch regulation, which has been the norm until now, is insufficient. 
We need capable governments that are well equipped, in terms of competencies, institutions and 
laws, to frame responsible AI development and protect the rule of law online, and public and private 
developers who are accountable for putting human rights and fundamental freedoms – not profits or 
geopolitical considerations – first.
The Readiness Assessment Methodology (RAM) is a diagnostic tool intended to assist Member States 
in upholding their commitment to the Recommendation by helping them understand how prepared 
they are to implement AI ethically and responsibly for all their citizens. By highlighting any institutional, 
regulatory or data gaps and obstacles, it enables UNESCO to tailor support for governments to fill 
those gaps in order to ensure an ethical AI ecosystem aligned with the Recommendation.
India’s readiness assessment presents a compelling portrait of a nation actively shaping its AI 
trajectory with a strategic vision and inclusive ambition. The Government of India has positioned 
AI as a central pillar of its digital transformation agenda, guided by the IndiaAI Mission, a flagship 
national programme to democratize access to AI and harness its benefits for social and economic 
development, and supported by a vibrant ecosystem of global technology companies, start-ups, 
academic institutions and public research bodies.
At the same time, the assessment highlights key areas that merit continued attention. Embedding 
ethical principles, such as fairness, accountability and transparency, into the operational design of AI 
systems remains an ongoing challenge, particularly in light of the rapid proliferation of generative AI. 
In addition, regional disparities in skilling opportunities and the gender gap in STEM education and 
employment risk limiting the inclusivity of India’s AI workforce.

Sustained investment in digital infrastructure, inclusive education and skilling, balanced regulation 
and multistakeholder dialogue will help ensure that AI development in India remains both innovation-
driven and anchored in values of equity, human rights and social inclusion, in line with the UNESCO 
Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence.
Overall, this report presents a fundamentally optimistic vision that we at UNESCO share: that ethical 
governance and responsible regulation of AI is entirely consistent with innovation and economic 
growth and is essential for ensuring a technological ecosystem that benefits the public good.
It was a pleasure working with the Government of India to conduct this exercise. We are grateful for 
their engagement with the RAM, and I am sure that, by following the path laid out in this report, India 
will be able to reap the benefits of AI while making sure that AI technologies deliver fair, sustainable 
and inclusive outcomes.

Executive summary 
India is witnessing rapid integration of artificial intelligence (AI) across sectors, catalysed by government 
interventions, investment, digital public infrastructure, and an expanding innovation ecosystem. 
Recognizing the potential of AI to contribute to inclusive growth and sustainable development, 
India undertook a national assessment using UNESCO’s Readiness Assessment Methodology (RAM). 
This diagnostic tool is designed to help Member States evaluate their preparedness to implement 
the Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence adopted by UNESCO in 2021, of which 
India is a signatory. It supports countries in identifying institutional and policy gaps and enables 
the formulation of targeted interventions aligned with the Recommendation’s human-rights-based, 
ethical and inclusive principles.
This report presents the findings from India’s RAM process, which combined secondary data analysis 
with extensive multistakeholder consultations. The secondary research informing this report reflects 
sources available up to 31 December 2025. The assessment is structured across five key dimensions: 
legal and regulatory, social and cultural, scientific and educational, economic, and technical and 
infrastructural. For each dimension, the report examines existing frameworks, evaluates gaps, 
identifies emerging priorities, and suggests future policy directions.
Legal and regulatory dimension
In India, AI governance is shaped by a combination of horizontal and sector-specific approaches. 
The Government of India has sought to balance enabling AI innovation with addressing emerging 
harms. Existing laws are applied to AI systems, while domain-specific standards are being developed 
to address context-sensitive risks. Alongside formal legal instruments, soft governance tools, including 
voluntary guidelines, ethical standards, and self-regulation by industry bodies, are being developed 
through multistakeholder (government and non-government, including industry, start-ups, academia, 
researchers, think tanks, legal/policy experts and civil society) consultations. Institutionally, the overall 
policy direction for AI in India is guided by the IndiaAI Mission under the Ministry of Electronics 
and Information Technology; the Office of the Principal Scientific Adviser; and NITI Aayog, the apex 
public policy think tank of the Government of India. In terms of policies and strategies, India’s current 
approach to AI governance is guided by the IndiaAI Governance Guidelines released in November 
2025, alongside the IndiaAI Mission.
Implementation is led by sector-specific ministries at the central level, while state governments are 
increasingly engaged in advancing AI adoption through regional policies, innovation programmes, and 
public sector deployments. However, challenges remain around ensuring applicability and effective 
enforcement of existing laws to AI systems, translating ethical principles into model development, 
ensuring regulatory coherence across sectors, and coordination between national and subnational 
AI priorities.
Social and cultural dimension
In India, the sociocultural context plays a central role in shaping how AI is designed, deployed and 
experienced. The Government of India has emphasized the need for AI systems to reflect the country’s 
linguistic, regional and demographic diversity. Programmes such as Bhashini and other multilingual 
initiatives aim to expand availability in Indian languages. Public engagement efforts, including 
digital literacy schemes and awareness campaigns, are being expanded to improve understanding 
and adoption of AI across varied population groups. At the institutional level, efforts are underway

to mainstream inclusion in AI skilling, particularly through regional training hubs and targeted 
fellowships. Civil society and academic institutions have also contributed to advancing discourse 
on representation, fairness and accessibility in AI design. However, challenges remain in closing 
gender and regional gaps in access to and development of AI systems, ensuring participation of 
under-represented communities, integrating environmental considerations into AI and embedding 
contextual awareness into datasets and models.
Scientific and educational dimension
India’s AI development has been supported by a growing focus on research, skilling and interdisciplinary 
collaboration. Initiatives under the IndiaAI FutureSkills pillar and the establishment of AI Centres 
of Excellence, which aim to build foundational and applied capabilities across academic, technical 
and vocational streams. Research output has increased steadily, with contributions from both public 
institutions and industry-led innovation labs. Several initiatives, focusing on curriculum reforms and 
faculty training programmes, are being introduced to align AI education with evolving technological 
needs. Interdisciplinary efforts, combining law, ethics, computer science and public policy, are 
also being explored to embed responsible AI principles into academic settings. Public-private 
partnerships are helping expand access to advanced training and foster linkages between research 
and deployment. Government agencies have issued guidance to support responsible research and 
encourage open access to AI knowledge resources. However, challenges remain in broadening access 
to AI education outside metropolitan regions, integration of ethics with technical training in AI, and 
expanding investments in AI research and development.
Economic dimension
India’s AI ecosystem is shaped by a combination of public sector initiatives, private enterprise and start-
up-led innovation. The Indian Government has prioritized AI as a driver of productivity and service 
delivery in sectors such as healthcare, agriculture, education and logistics. Enterprise adoption of AI 
is consistently growing, with firms and start-ups increasingly developing and deploying AI systems, 
both to enhance internal operations and address socio-economic needs across priority sectors. The 
IndiaAI Mission includes dedicated pillars to support start-ups in developing AI applications for 
public benefit. Innovation programmes at the state level complement national efforts and encourage 
regional entrepreneurship. Preparing for the evolving impact of AI on employment and labour market 
transitions remains an area of ongoing work. While India is undertaking large-scale skilling initiatives 
through public and private efforts, ensuring their reach and their alignment with emerging workforce 
needs remains a challenge.
Technical and infrastructural dimension
India’s digital infrastructure provides a foundation for scaled deployment of AI applications across 
sectors. Public digital platforms like Aadhaar, the unified payments interface (UPI) and the Open 
Network for Digital Commerce have enabled interoperable systems for authentication, payments and 
commerce, many of which integrate AI-enabled functionalities. Under the IndiaAI Mission, programmes 
have been launched to expand access to compute resources, including public cloud infrastructure 
and graphics processing unit (GPU) availability. The AIKosh and India Datasets platforms are designed 
to improve access to anonymized, high-quality datasets for training and testing AI models. National 
standards bodies such as the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) and the Telecommunication Engineering 
Centre (TEC) are contributing to international efforts on AI standards, while also adapting frameworks 
for domestic use. However, challenges remain in ensuring equitable access to AI infrastructure such as 
compute capacity, and operationalizing technical standards for safety, auditability and fairness.

Key findings from stakeholder consultations
                             
AI governance and policy in India
Stakeholders emphasized the need for AI governance frameworks that encourage innovation while 
managing risk through clear, flexible and principle-based approaches, supported by industry-led 
standards and government oversight. They cautioned against overly prescriptive models and also 
noted gaps in operational guidance for smaller firms and start-ups. They stressed the importance of a 
whole-of-government approach, and of periodic review of legal adequacy as AI risks evolve. 
Stakeholders highlighted the need to reinforce coordination and capacity across central and state 
governments while also expanding AI-related infrastructure and opportunities beyond metropolitan 
hubs to address uneven readiness and digital divides. On procurement, they stressed structured, 
ethical and transparent processes, noting that formal guidelines will be essential in shaping industry 
norms for safe and responsible AI.
 
AI adoption: enablers and barriers
Stakeholders noted that large volumes of government data remain under-used due to unclear access 
rules and quality issues (like incomplete, unstructured or unrepresentative datasets), particularly in 
sectors like health and education. They stressed the need for culturally and regionally representative 
data to ensure inclusive AI systems, while also accounting for fair compensation for contributing 
communities.
Stakeholders further emphasized coordination challenges in data gathering, access and use, calling 
for common standards and formal mechanisms such as a data task force under an inter-ministerial 
coordination committee (IMCC) to improve governance across ministries and states. They stressed the 
need for greater awareness, onboarding and capacity building to ensure effective use of platforms, 
alongside clearer rules to facilitate data sharing across the public ecosystem. Participants highlighted 
that strengthening public trust is essential for wider AI adoption, requiring transparency, user-centric 
design and ethical deployment, and noted the government’s role in setting standards for transparency 
and accountability. Start-ups further highlighted the need for flexible regulatory sandboxes, clearer 
sector-specific guidance, support for responsible AI practices, and better access to risk-tolerant 
financing and co-investment models.
 
Preparing India’s workforce for AI
Stakeholders noted that AI is reshaping India’s workforce by automating not only routine work but also 
cognitive and mid-career roles in sectors such as IT/IT enabled services (IT/ITES) and financial services, 
raising concerns about job security and the loss of on-the-job learning pathways. They highlighted the 
need for clear transition routes into AI-related roles, supported by well-trained instructors, updated 
pedagogy and stronger academia-industry collaboration, alongside more specialized training in 
areas such as model development, data stewardship and ethical AI. 
The consultations also brought to light barriers to skilling, with rural and underserved areas requiring 
more support for infrastructure, localized content and structured support. Participants stressed 
that skilling initiatives must be inclusive, accessible, and not limited to technical training. They also 
addressed over-reliance on generative AI by students, which was felt to be weakening critical thinking. 
Finally, building public-sector capacity was identified as urgent, requiring improved AI literacy and 
regulatory clarity to support responsible AI adoption in essential public services.

Infrastructure and investment
Stakeholders acknowledged ongoing government efforts to expand compute infrastructure but 
stressed the need for greater awareness, access and targeted support for start-ups and innovators 
outside major metropolitan cities. As AI activity grows in smaller cities, participants called for increased 
research and development (R&D) funding, the use of foreign compute as a temporary bridge, and parallel 
development of domestic capabilities through stronger local supply chains and strategic international 
partnerships. Power reliability and environmental impacts were identified as major constraints, 
prompting calls for energy-efficient models, task-appropriate accuracy benchmarks and life-cycle-based 
environmental metrics. Participants recommended strengthening environmental impact assessments 
for AI infrastructure and introducing measures such as renewable energy thresholds and environmental, 
social, and governance (ESG)-linked procurement. 
On investment, stakeholders highlighted persistent gaps in long-term financing and inequitable 
infrastructure distribution, noting that private funding remains concentrated in high-return enterprise 
applications. They urged targeted government incentives, ethical procurement practices and public-
private partnerships to support socially beneficial, inclusive and responsible AI development.
Recommendations
The recommendations of this report are grounded in rigorous secondary research and an inclusive 
stakeholder engagement process conducted as part of India’s RAM assessment. Between November 
2024 and June 2025, over 600 stakeholders, including government officials, start-up entrepreneurs, 
civil society actors, youth, and technology providers, convened across five regional consultations. 
These discussions surfaced not only regulatory and implementation gaps but also a wide spectrum of 
perspectives, lived experiences and operational insights. The recommendations reflect these grounded 
inputs and present eight future policy directions aimed at strengthening India’s AI ecosystem in 
a manner that is ethical, inclusive and locally contextualized. Each of these directions is accompanied by 
an actionable roadmap to support their implementation.
 
Ensure informed AI governance across sectors through comprehensive evidence-based risk and 
legal review. 
India’s AI Safety Institute, in consultation with the AI Governance Group, and the Technology and 
Policy Expert Committee proposed under the AI Governance Guidelines, may conduct a national 
AI risk-mapping exercise and develop a shared taxonomy of harms (Roadmap 1.1), supported by 
a comprehensive legal review identifying regulatory gaps and coverage across existing frameworks 
(Roadmap 1.2). This comprehensive legal gap analysis may be undertaken by relevant authorities, 
in collaboration with the AI Governance Group proposed in the India AI Governance Guidelines.
 
Co-develop guidelines for operationalizing ethical AI principles for AI developers and deployers. 
The AI Safety Institute, in collaboration with private entities, may establish a voluntary repository of 
ethical AI practices (Roadmap 2.1); the IndiaAI Mission, in collaboration with private entities, may 
promote voluntary measures and commitments to promote ethical and safe AI development (Roadmap 
2.2); and line ministries may support AI developers through regulatory sandboxes and incentives for 
‘ethics by design’ (Roadmap 2.3). 
 
Strengthen centre–state coordination for AI governance and implementation.

Skilling Framework (NPAI-SF)1 and accelerate the implementation of pending recommendations 
(Roadmap 6.1). Further, the Education and Skilling ministries, in collaboration with the IndiaAI Mission 
and relevant authorities, may include AI ethics across various education and skilling levels (Roadmap 
6.2). Indian AI Centres of Excellence may also collaborate and prepare ‘training the trainers’ programmes, 
for both public and private sectors, across levels (Roadmap 6.3). The Ministry of Labour and Employment 
and the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship may develop an AI workforce transition 
platform to support reskilling and job mobility for at-risk workers (Roadmap 6.4). The IndiaAI Mission, 
in collaboration with the Atal Innovation Mission and AI Centres of Excellence may expand structured 
youth engagement through mentorship and innovation platforms (Roadmap 6.5) and strengthening 
existing mechanisms for capacity-building programmes on AI for public officials (Roadmap 6.6).
 
Ensure integration of environmental sustainability considerations into AI infrastructure planning 
and deployment. 
The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, along with other ministries, may undertake 
a comprehensive study on the environmental costs of AI and its implications for India (Roadmap 7.1) 
and expand the environmental impact assessment framework to cover AI infrastructure (Roadmap 
7.2). This is particularly relevant as AI models and data centres require substantial energy and water 
resources, with measurable carbon impacts.2 A clearer understanding of these effects would support 
environmentally responsible planning for India’s growing AI infrastructure.
 
Ensure targeted interventions to promote diversity in the AI workforce and research and 
development ecosystem. 
The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology and the Ministry of Education may launch 
targeted mentorship and innovation programmes for under- represented groups (Roadmap 8.1) and 
expand regional-language AI skilling in non- metropolitan regions (Roadmap 8.2). The IT Ministry and 
other line ministries may embed inclusion metrics into public research funding and grant evaluations 
(Roadmap 8.3).

CHAPTER 1 
Diagnosis of the national AI landscape
AI governance in India: an overview of legal structure, policies and institutions
India has a quasi-federal structure. Under India’s Constitution, legislative powers are distributed 
between the centre and the states through three lists: the Union List, the State List, and the Concurrent 
List. Each branch plays an important role in shaping the trajectory of AI in India.
The Union List includes subjects on which only the Union Legislature may make laws, such as telegraphs, 
telephones, wireless, and broadcasting. The State List includes matters where states exercise exclusive 
authority, such as police, public health, law and order, and education. The Concurrent List allows both 
the centre and the states to legislate on subjects such as criminal law and insolvency, with central law 
prevailing in case of conflict. This federal design ensures that policy-making reflects India’s diversity: 
states have both the power and the obligation to adapt national frameworks to local conditions, 
making governance inherently contextual and negotiated. 
Parliament 
The Indian Parliament remains central to the lawmaking process, with the power to debate and pass 
bills introduced by the executive. Additionally, members of parliament regularly exercise oversight 
by raising questions or interventions related to AI policies, ethics and safety, investments, global 
cooperation, and regulatory approaches, and by introducing private member bills.3 Parliamentary 
committees play a key role in examining government action – particularly the Standing Committee 
on Communications and Information Technology,4 which has selected, among other subjects, the 
‘Impact of emergence of Artificial Intelligence and related issues’ for examination.
The executive
The President of India is the constitutional head of the executive at the union level. A Council of 
Ministers,5 headed by the Prime Minister, aids and advises the President through fifty-three ministries 
and two independent departments.6 It sets national priorities and agendas, including regulations and 
policies, implementation of programmes, and the adoption of and standard setting for AI in India. 
Ministries function as specialized arms of the executive, operating in coordination with one another 
while aligning their actions with the broader vision articulated by the Prime Minister and the Council 
of Ministers.
Policy planning and strategy
•  The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY, or the IT Ministry) is the nodal 
ministry for formulating and implementing AI-related policies and programmes. The IndiaAI Mission 
(the Mission) is a national mission to establish a robust and inclusive AI ecosystem that aligns with 
the country’s development goals. This mission is driven by a vision to position India as a global 
leader in AI. The IT Ministry is also the primary ministry implementing the Information Technology 
Act7 that governs information technology in India and regulates matters related to data governance, 
cybersecurity and digital technologies, including AI.
•  The Office of Principal Scientific Advisor (PSA) provides advice to the prime minister in matters 
of science and technology, including those related to AI. The PSA coordinates AI initiatives with 
the IndiaAI Mission and other ministries. In 2023, the Government of India constituted a high-level 
advisory group, comprising members from government, industry, academia and legal experts,

### Page 20

chaired by the PSA, to examine various issues related to AI. After extensive deliberations, the 
committee set up a sub-committee on AI governance, which prepared a draft report on AI Governance 
Guidelines Development8 (PSA AI Report) that was published for public feedback in January 2025. 
After the consultation process, the final India AI Governance Guidelines (AI Governance Guidelines) 
were released in November 2025,9 articulating high-level principles for responsible AI development 
and deployment in India and providing overarching direction for ministries, states, industry and 
researchers. The report recommends adopting a ‘whole-of-government’ strategy to coordinate 
AI initiatives and policies across ministries and government departments. In December 2025, the 
Office of the PSA also released a white paper, Democratizing Access to AI Infrastructure, focusing on the 
availability and affordability of AI infrastructure such as compute, datasets and model ecosystems. 
•  NITI Aayog is the Government of India’s apex public policy think tank, guiding long-term strategic 
planning and promoting cooperative federalism across sectors, including emerging technologies 
like AI. In 2018, NITI Aayog released a National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence (NSAI),10 followed 
by three documents outlining approaches for responsible AI, between 2021 and 2022. Building 
on this, NITI Aayog has articulated the AI for Viksit Bharat roadmap, which focuses on accelerating 
AI adoption across industries and leveraging generative AI to transform research and innovation, 
alongside the AI for Inclusive Societal Development report examining the role of AI in improving the 
lives and livelihoods of India’s informal workforce. These documents articulate India’s vision for an 
inclusive AI ecosystem that seeks to democratize the use of AI technology and aims to ensure that 
AI benefits all sectors of society.11
Adoption and implementation of AI
While the IT Ministry, the Office of the PSA and NITI Aayog provide overarching policy guidance, 
various domain ministries in India, spanning telecommunications, health, defence, skill development, 
education, agriculture, urban affairs, corporate affairs, fisheries, science and technology, to name 
a few, have focused on sector-specific AI adoption. These adoption initiatives encompass using AI to 
both optimize internal government processes and to optimize public service delivery, drive economic 
productivity, and advance strategic and national security objectives.
Complementing these central efforts at the subnational level, Indian states are also shaping the 
country’s AI ecosystem. While the Union Government is responsible for specifically regulating AI and 
data protection, state governments have been building an enabling environment for AI adoption 
through policies that attract investment, promote innovation and leverage AI solutions for public 
service delivery.

Regulation and standard setting
Sector-specific regulators in India are independent statutory bodies responsible for overseeing and 
guiding the development, compliance and ethical use of technologies within their respective domains, 
such as telecommunications, health, banking and financial markets.12 As this report will explain 
in detail in subsequent chapters, regulatory agencies for these sectors ensure that AI applications 
align with larger sectoral norms and public interest. India also has sector-agnostic regulators and 
bodies that address cross-cutting concerns in AI governance. These agencies oversee areas such as 
competition, consumer protection, data governance, and technology standards, and are responsible 
for ensuring fairness, accountability, safety and interoperability in the deployment of AI and other 
emerging technologies.13
The judiciary
The judiciary plays an important role in interpreting how existing laws apply to emerging AI 
technologies, especially in cases involving privacy, accountability and human rights. Courts have also 
increasingly adopted AI-enabled technologies that focus on improving access to justice. Some of these 
include AI-assisted legal research and translation, improving administrative efficiency, intelligent 
scheduling, enhancing case information systems, and communicating with litigants.14
India’s engagements with global AI: forums and frameworks
India has been actively participating in global AI dialogues to increase its contributions to global 
AI governance. The country has encouraged greater equity in access to AI resources and broader 
participation of countries from the Global South in international AI governance discussions, with the 
aim of promoting a more inclusive and cooperative global AI landscape.15
In 2021, India was one of 193 countries that adopted the UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics 
of Artificial Intelligence, signalling its commitment to ethical AI development.16 Currently, UNESCO 
is working with the IT Ministry to ensure that the core values and principles of the UNESCO 
Recommendation are translated into concrete policy action through initiatives such as the Readiness 
Assessment Methodology. India has drawn on these international principles and adapted them to 
its domestic context through various policy frameworks, as evident from NITI Aayog’s Responsible 
AI documents (2021–2022), the AI Governance Guidelines, and the Safe and Trusted AI pillar of the 
IndiaAI Mission.
At the 2023 G20 Summit held in New Delhi, India joined other G20 members in reaffirming its 
commitment to the 2019 G20 AI Principles. It also endorsed a pro-innovation regulatory and 
governance approach to AI that maximizes its benefits while addressing associated risks. The 
Declaration emphasized the importance of responsible, inclusive and human-centric AI development, 
grounded in the protection of human rights, and in safety, transparency, accountability, fairness and 
ethical considerations. India also supported global cooperation on AI governance and highlighted 
the role of AI in advancing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).17 As Lead Chair of the Global 
Partnership of AI (GPAI) in 2023, India advocated for equitable access to critical AI resources, including 
AI computing, high-quality diverse datasets, algorithms, software and test beds, reaffirming the need 
for the Global South to play a more active role in global AI discussions.18 India is also a member of 
the Hiroshima AI Process Friends Group,19 which involves a collaborative effort by member countries 
to develop a comprehensive policy framework for AI that includes guiding principles and codes of 
conduct aimed at promoting safe, secure and trustworthy AI systems.
India will host the AI Impact Summit in February 2026 following the AI Action Summit it co-hosted 
with France in 2025.20 India has participated in previous editions of the AI Summits in the United

Kingdom (2022), where it signed the Bletchley Declaration,21 and in South Korea (2024). For the 
upcoming AI Impact Summit 2026, India has made a strategic shift from ‘Action’ to ‘Impact’, with 
a focus on tangible outcomes, global collaboration and responsible deployment.22 Guided by three 
overarching considerations, ’People, Planet and Progress’, the summit’s objectives include:
1.  Democratizing access to AI resources by making compute, data and tools widely available.
2.  Enabling inclusive global development through AI applications that address real-world challenges 
in healthcare, education, agriculture and governance.
3.  Harnessing AI for a resilient and sustainable planet.
4.  Making AI systems secure, transparent, human-centric, fair and trusted.
5.  Enabling the development of local, contextual, multilingual and culturally grounded AI.
6.  Empowering voices of the Global South in global AI governance and innovation.
7.  Bridging the global AI divide to ensure its benefits accrue to all.
Opportunities and challenges in India’s AI ecosystem: an overview
Following the above overview of India’s legal and institutional frameworks and its growing 
engagement in global AI dialogues, this section briefly examines India’s domestic AI context, including 
opportunities and challenges.
Opportunities
India is positioned to play an increasingly prominent role in the global AI ecosystem, backed by 
a growing digital economy, a broad base of technical talent, and a dynamic start-up and innovation 
landscape. NITI Aayog's 2025 report, AI for Viksit Bharat, estimates that widespread AI adoption could 
boost India’s GDP by up to USD 1.9 trillion by 2035, helping the economy grow at an annual rate of 
8 per cent and reach a target of USD 8.3 trillion.23 By 2035, faster AI adoption could add USD 500 
billion to USD 600 billion to India’s GDP beyond baseline growth, primarily through productivity gains. 
Financial services and manufacturing are poised for the largest impact, with 20 per cent to 25 per 
cent of their sectoral GDP potentially driven by AI. In finance alone, AI-led efficiencies could unlock 
an additional USD 50 billion to USD 55 billion over current projections. Start-ups have been central 
to this growth, with over 150,000 start-ups currently recognized by the Department for Promotion of 
Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT),24 Government of India, and over 2,900 start-ups focusing on AI.25
Global benchmarks reflect India’s growing capacity in AI-related skills and innovation. International 
indices rank India second globally in AI skill penetration (2.5) and report a 252 per cent increase in 
its AI talent pool between 2016–2024.26 This indicates a considerable expansion in the human capital 
associated with AI in India. The World Intellectual Property Organization ranks India fifth globally in 
AI patent filings, signalling the expanding research and innovation pipeline in the country.27
India has prioritized some sectors for government intervention in the development and application 
of AI. As outlined in various policy documents, public sector domains such as agriculture, healthcare, 
education, smart cities and e-governance have been identified as priority areas for strategic 
intervention, including through policy support, pilot programmes and targeted funding. India has 
also positioned itself as a testing ground for scalable, context-aware AI solutions that can be adapted 
to other emerging and developing economies. The country’s socio-economic diversity, multilingual 
population and robust digital public infrastructure offer a conducive environment for inclusive 
AI innovation. This approach, described in policy discourse as ‘solve for India, solve for 40 per cent of 
the world’, illustrates India’s ambition to contribute globally adaptable solutions.28

### Page 24

11
Parallelly, India’s AI ecosystem spans both mature and emerging sectors: financial services, 
telecommunications and logistics already demonstrate advanced AI integration, while healthcare, 
education and consumer goods are seeing growing experimentation. Indian software as a service 
(SaaS) firms and IT companies are also embedding AI into enterprise platforms used globally, reinforcing 
the country’s position as a destination for developing and scaling cost-effective, multilingual and 
transferable AI applications. This flows from India’s vision to become the ‘AI garage’ for the world, 
offering a practical environment for piloting AI technologies with global relevance.29
Challenges
Despite ongoing progress, challenges persist in India’s AI ecosystem, as reflected in policy analyses and 
stakeholder consultations. Global benchmarking studies underscore these gaps. The Oxford Insights 
Government AI Readiness Index (2025) ranks India 27th of 195 countries, highlighting limitations 
across dimensions such as institutional capacity, data availability and governance frameworks.30 
Similarly, the Tortoise Global AI Index ranks India 68th of 83 countries for AI infrastructure, indicating 
the need for deeper investment in compute capacity and AI research. 
During stakeholder consultations, a recurring theme was the need to expand AI skill development 
beyond urban and English-speaking populations. Participants emphasized the importance of making 
AI training available in regional languages to improve workforce preparedness across different parts 
of the country. Equitable access to compute infrastructure and other foundational resources was also 
identified as essential for enabling wider participation in AI development, particularly for smaller 
institutions and start-ups. Moreover, issues such as the lack of high quality, representative datasets 
across sectors and the absence of robust, interoperable data-sharing frameworks were seen as barriers 
to developing efficient and inclusive AI systems. Finally, while the government’s principles-based, 
‘whole-of- government’ approach to AI governance was broadly appreciated, stakeholders underlined 
the need for practical mechanisms and sector-specific guidance to operationalize responsible 
AI principles.31
Overview of assessment dimensions
The following chapters of this report provide a detailed assessment of India’s AI landscape through 
the lens of the five dimensions outlined in UNESCO’s AI Readiness Assessment Methodology. 
These dimensions serve as a comprehensive framework to evaluate countries’ capacities to govern 
AI ethically.
1.  The legal and regulatory dimension examines the presence, implementation, and enforcement 
capacity of regulatory frameworks that can guide the ethical development and deployment of AI, 
particularly considering the societal changes brought about by AI adoption across sectors.
2.  The social and cultural dimension explores how factors such as public awareness, cultural 
diversity, inclusiveness and shared social values shape the development and acceptance of ethical 
AI systems.
3.  The scientific and educational dimension assesses a country’s research and development capacity 
in AI, along with the accessibility and quality of AI-related education and training.
4.  The economic dimension considers the structure, scale and capabilities of domestic AI ecosystems, 
particularly in terms of their ability to create context-specific, locally relevant AI solutions.
5.  Finally, the technical and infrastructural dimension reviews the state of digital and information 
and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure necessary to support AI integration and 
innovation at scale.

CHAPTER 2
Legal and regulatory dimension
The legal and regulatory dimension of the RAM evaluates India’s readiness to govern AI. This chapter 
maps India’s efforts to build AI governance frameworks while maintaining regulatory agility and 
ensuring AI technologies are safe, accountable and aligned with constitutional values. This includes 
examining AI policy development, data protection and privacy laws; procurement rules; transparency 
mechanisms like the Right to Information (RTI); and human rights frameworks such as freedom of 
expression and due process. It also tracks the maturity of institutional safeguards, including grievance 
redress systems and accountability mechanisms across the AI value chain.
AI policy and regulation
Overview
India has adopted a policy approach that does not favour hard overarching AI regulation at this stage, 
with government officials and policy documents indicating a preference to avoid overly prescriptive 
regulatory frameworks that could impact innovation.32 The country’s current strategy focuses 
on responding to emerging harms and mitigating risks through existing legal provisions and soft 
governance mechanisms including voluntary guidelines, ethical standards, industry self-regulation 
initiatives, and multistakeholder consultation processes. Concurrently, sectoral regulators are 
examining AI governance within their respective domains, with financial, telecommunications and 
health regulators developing sector-specific standards and requirements tailored to address domain-
specific risks and create accountability mechanisms.
Evolution of AI regulation and policy
A key starting point for India’s deliberations on AI governance can be traced to 2017, with the 
constitution of a task force on artificial intelligence by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry 
(Commerce Ministry). The task force was established to recommend a policy and legal framework for 
the deployment of AI technologies and to provide guidance for government, industry and research 
institutions. The resulting report, published in 2018, explicitly acknowledged the importance of ethical 
and safe AI, calling for the development of ethical frameworks to guide responsible AI deployment in 
India. It also recommended the creation of a National AI Mission – an inter-ministerial nodal agency to 
coordinate AI-related activities in India.33
In ensuing years, several government-constituted multistakeholder expert committees have 
deliberated on a potential AI governance framework for India; the outcome for each such expert group 
being the publication of a report that sought to inform the approach or vision of the government’s 
policies on AI. These reports include NITI Aayog’s National Strategy for AI (2018), the IT Ministry’s four 
AI Expert Committee Reports (2019), the first IndiaAI Report by Expert Group (IndiaAI Report) (2023), 
and the India AI Governance Guidelines (2025). Figure 1 lists all such reports released between 2017 
and 2025.

In May 2020, during the interim budget speech 2019/2020, the government announced the National 
Programme on AI (AI Programme), an umbrella initiative for using transformative technologies to 
promote inclusion, innovation and adoption for social impact. This programme culminated in the 
IndiaAI Mission, launched in 2024.
Across these various expert committees and policy reports, some common themes emerged in India’s 
evolving approach to AI governance. These include an emphasis on adopting an agile, principles-based 
regulatory framework that enables innovation while addressing key ethical and safety considerations. 
They also recognize the importance of responsible AI development, and articulate the need for ethical 
principles to guide AI adoption rather than overly prescriptive horizontal legislation. They propose 
that regulatory guidance be sector-specific, allowing ministries and regulators to tailor guidance to 
the contexts in which AI systems are deployed. These reports also recommend enabling organizations 
to design their own compliance processes within a flexible national framework. 
Collectively, these recommendations have informed the government’s approach to AI policy- making, 
which aims to balance innovation and public benefit/safety.
While a range of policy documents have informed India’s approach to AI governance, the country 
does not currently have an AI-specific law. The government has maintained, in public forums34 and 
in Parliament, that existing legal frameworks such as the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 
(DPDPA or Data Protection Act), the Information Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act), and the Copyright Act, 
1957, can be leveraged to address AI-related harms. The AI Governance Guidelines broadly suggest 
that existing laws are sufficient to cover risks related to synthetic content, cybersecurity, intellectual 
property and bias, but also highlight the need for further study to evaluate enforcement capacity and 
legal adequacy.35 In April 2025, the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) 
constituted a multistakeholder committee to examine legal and policy issues on generative AI and 
copyright, prepare a working paper evaluating the adequacy of existing frameworks, and provide 
recommendations.36 Part 1 of the working paper was released for public consultation in December 
2025.37

Four expert committee reports 
The IT Ministry established four multistakeholder expert committees to develop a policy framework for AI in India. The four 
expert committees included forty-five members. Of these, twenty were academicians, eleven were representatives from 
government bodies, and fourteen were from the private sector and industry associations.iii The committees focused on: 
(1) platforms and data; (2) national missions; (3) technological capabilities and policy enablers; and (4) cybersecurity, safety,
legal and ethics (Report on Cybersecurity, Legal and Ethical Issues). The reports made several key recommendations, including
establishing an open national AI resource platform as a central hub for AI / machine learning research and knowledge sharing. 
The Report on Cybersecurity & Ethics recommended a sector-specific approach to AI regulation instead of a horizontal law and
called for a governance framework based on broad principles, allowing organizations to define their own compliance processes.
NITI Aayog strategy papers
NITI Aayog released a two-part approach document on responsible Al. Part 1iv outlined ethical principles for Al, such 
as safety, non-discrimination, transparency and accountability. These principles were derived from the Constitution, 
following stakeholder consultations. Part 2v focused on operationalizing these principles through policy and 
regulatory interventions. It proposed a risk-based classification of Al systems (low, unclear, high), and recommended 
self-regulation, policy sandboxes or stricter oversight based on risk levels. It also called for establishing a council 
for ethics and technology to guide implementation, promote data access and support both public and private 
sector adoption of responsible Al. Developed in collaboration with the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution 
at the World Economic Forum, it also involved inputs and contributions from multiple Indian ministries, NITI Aayog, 
industry actors, academic institutions, multilateral organizations and civil society groups.
INDIAai Report 
Seven multistakeholder working groupsvi constituted under the INDIAai Mission brainstormed the vision, 
objectives, outcomes and design for each of the Mission’s pillars. These groups brought together representatives 
from academia, industry, start-ups, civil society and government. Of the sixty-eight members, nine were women. In 
October 2023, the IT Ministry released the first edition of the expert groups’ report, providing specific actionables 
like setting up Centres of Excellence for AI research, institutionalizing the India Dataset Platform, designing 
a national data management office, scaling AI compute infrastructure, etc.
India AI Governance Guidelines 
In November 2025, building on a draft by the Principal Scientific Advisor (PSA), the IT Ministry released the IndiaAI 
Governance Guidelines, which set out a national framework for safe and trusted AI, emphasizing an innovation-first 
approach.vii They outline seven foundational principles for responsible AI, provide non-prescriptive recommendations 
across six pillars (covering infrastructure, capacity building, regulation, risk mitigation, accountability, and institutional 
design) and present a phased action plan for short-, medium- and long-term implementation. The guidelines propose 
a whole-of-government model anchored in new institutional mechanisms, including an AI governance group and the 
AI Safety Institute. They also offer practical guidance for industry and regulators, highlighting voluntary commitments, 
transparency measures and techno-legal approaches for AI oversight.
Figure 1: India’s AI governance journey
AI TASKFORCE
The Commerce Ministry established a multistakeholder task force to develop a policy framework for India’s AI ecosystem.i 
The task force had nineteen members, including two women. Its composition included representatives from academia (five), 
government (six), industry (seven) and one independent expert. The report recommended creating a central AI agency, 
establishing data banks and exchanges, promoting interoperability, and introducing AI-focused education and reskilling. 
It also emphasized responsible AI governance, calling for principles such as explainability, transparency, safety, data protection, 
human oversight in high-risk systems, and efforts to mitigate bias.
National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence
NITI Aayog developed a National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence (NSAI) in consultation with a range of stakeholders.ii 
Contributions were made by officials at NITI Aayog, academic experts and representatives from industry and research 
institutions. It also received inputs from private sector stakeholders, including technology companies and consulting firms. 
The strategy identified key challenges to AI adoption and proposed government action across three areas: promoting 
research and skill development, accelerating adoption, and ensuring responsible AI. Some recommendations have since 
been implemented, including the creation of the AI Research Analytics and Knowledge Dissemination Platform (AIRAWAT), 
a national cloud platform, and centres of excellence.

India’s regulators are also actively participating in the conversation on AI governance. Agencies such 
as the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)38 and Telecommunication Engineering Centre (TEC) 
have released frameworks for enabling responsible AI development, deployment and use, and for 
fairness assessments.39 Further, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has issued a Framework for Responsible 
and Ethical Enablement of AI (FREE-AI) which outlines principles and safeguards for responsible AI 
adoption in the financial sector, including governance requirements and reporting mechanisms, and 
also proposes updates to existing frameworks.40 The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) 
has published a consultation paper proposing guidelines for the supervision and governance of AI 
and machine-learning tools used by market participants.41 The Indian telecom regulator released 
recommendations for leveraging AI and big data in the telecom sector,42 calling for a unified regulatory 
framework across industries and an independent, multistakeholder statutory advisory body to govern 
AI systems. The Department of Consumer Affairs is working on formulating standards for AI-powered 
claims.43 The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has recently completed a market study on AI and 
competition, mapping emerging risks in AI-enabled markets and identifying implications for future 
enforcement and policy development, including in relation to the proposed Digital Competition Bill.44
Constitutional bodies, such as the Election Commission of India (ECI) and the Comptroller and Auditor 
General of India (CAG) have also taken cognizance of AI in their respective domains. The ECI released 
an advisory on the responsible use of AI in political campaigning, including safeguards against 
deepfakes, misinformation and automated persuasion.45 The CAG released an Artificial Intelligence 
Strategy Framework in April 2025 to integrate AI into public auditing and to guide the audit of 
AI systems used by government bodies.46

India also has a Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), responsible for developing domestic standards, 
and adapting global standards to India. An expert-led committee under the BIS oversees standards 
relating to AI and big data.47
While there are currently no monitoring and evaluation or assessment requirements mandated before 
deploying AI technologies, the IT Ministry issued an advisory in March 2024 on the safe and responsible 
use of AI on digital platforms.48 The advisory asked online intermediaries to ensure that AI tools do not 
enable unlawful content, discrimination or risks to the electoral process. It also encourages transparent 
user notices and the use of metadata to help identify AI-generated or modified content, particularly to 
limit the spread of misinformation and deepfakes.
In October 2025, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY or IT Ministry) 
released draft amendments to the IT (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 
2021,49 to propose additional obligations relating to ‘synthetically generated information’ (SGI). The 
amendment defines SGI broadly to include any artificially or algorithmically generated or altered 
content and proposes obligations such as prominent labelling, permanent metadata identifiers 
and safeguards to prevent removal of such labels. Significant social media intermediaries must also 
enable user declarations for SGI content and deploy technical measures to verify these declarations. 
These proposals aim to address risks associated with deepfakes, misinformation and other forms of 
artificially generated content presented as authentic.50
IndiaAI Mission
The IndiaAI Mission is a flagship initiative for AI, launched by the Government of India in March 2024, 
with a five-year budget of INR 10,371.92 crore51 (approximately USD 1.2 billion).52 The Mission serves 
as a key institutional mechanism for advancing India’s national priorities on AI. It operates as an 
independent business division under the Digital India Corporation, a not-for-profit entity established 
by the IT Ministry.53 While not a regulatory body, the IndiaAI Mission plays a central role in India’s 
AI governance ecosystem by supporting policy development, inter-ministerial coordination, public 
engagement, and ecosystem development. Anchored within the broader Digital India architecture, 
it enables implementation-level support for AI initiatives and contributes to the operationalization of 
India’s AI strategy. Its seven pillars reflect India’s pro-innovation approach to AI governance, focusing 
on enabling infrastructure, inclusive development and responsible deployment, aiming to build 
a comprehensive AI ecosystem:
1.  IndiaAI Compute Capacity 
This pillar seeks to build high-end, scalable AI compute infrastructure to support India’s AI start-up 
and research ecosystem.54 As of May 2025, the government, in collaboration with private entities, has 
made 38,231 graphics processing units (GPUs) available.55 Empanelment of further entities to provide 
compute resources is ongoing.
2.  IndiaAI Foundation Models 
This pillar focuses on developing indigenous large language models (LLMs) and domain-specific 
foundational models for India.56 In January 2025, the IT Ministry launched a call for proposals inviting 
researchers, start-ups, etc. to develop indigenous AI foundational models based on Indian datasets. 
As of December 2025, twelve start-ups have been shortlisted to develop indigenous, foundational AI 
models.57
3.  AIKosh/India Datasets Platform (IDP) 
This pillar aims to create a national repository that seeks to enhance access, quality and utilization

### Page 30

of public sector datasets, models and use cases for AI development.58 In March 2025, the Mission 
launched AIKosh, a platform designed to democratize access to non-personal, anonymized datasets 
and support the development of AI solutions across sectors. As of November 2025, the platform offers 
over 1,400 datasets, 200+ AI models, 20+ AI use cases and 10+ toolkits, along with tutorials to help 
users understand available features. It also provides tools to make datasets AI-ready and ensures 
secure, compliant and controlled access in line with applicable regulations. The Mission is actively 
expanding this platform.59
4.  IndiaAI Application Development Initiative (AIADI) 
This pillar promotes the development of AI applications to catalyse socio-economic transformation.60 
In August 2024, the IT Ministry announced the IndiaAI Innovation Challenge, offering up to INR 1 crore 
(approximately USD 112,000) for AI solutions in healthcare, agriculture, governance, climate change, 
and assistive technologies for persons with learning disabilities. As of April 2025, thirty AI solutions 
have been shortlisted for funding.61 Thirty applications have reached the prototyping stage, with 
a second iteration of the challenge planned in conjunction with the Ministry of Education. Additionally, 
sector-specific hackathons/Innovation Challenges have been organized with the Indian Cybercrime 
Coordination Centre, the Geological Survey of India and the National Cancer Grid (NCG) to further 
encourage focused AI solution development.
5.  IndiaAI FutureSkills 
This pillar focuses on expanding AI education at all academic levels and improving AI skilling 
among the workforce, aiming to support 500 Ph.D. fellows, 8,000 undergraduate students and 5,000 
postgraduate students across a variety of disciplines. It also aims to establish data and AI labs in Tier 
2 and Tier 3 cities. As of April 2025, 150 undergraduate, 48 postgraduate and 3 doctoral students 
have been awarded IndiaAI fellowships. As part of this pillar, 570 data and AI labs will be established 
across the country, of which 27 labs have been launched in collaboration with the National Institute 
of Electronics & Information Technology (NIELIT) and aim to train over 10,000 students in data and AI 
foundational courses tailored to India’s diverse development needs 
6.  IndiaAI Startup Financing 
This pillar aims to provide support to AI start-ups at all stages. The Mission is currently deliberating a 
funding scheme for AI start-ups at pre-seed, seed and growth stages.62 Additionally, the Mission has 
collaborated with Station F and HEC Paris to launch the IndiaAI Startups Global programme, which 
aims to support 10 Indian AI start-ups in expanding into the European market.63
7.  Safe and Trusted AI
This pillar focuses on ensuring the responsible development, deployment and adoption of AI by 
implementing responsible AI projects, developing indigenous tools and frameworks and self-
assessment checklists for innovators, and other guidelines and governance frameworks.64 It operates 
horizontally across the other six pillars, integrating ethical AI principles throughout the IndiaAI 
Mission. Under this pillar, the government floated two expressions of interest (EOIs) to develop 
techno-legal solutions that promote ethics and safety in AI, contextualized to the Indian landscape. 
Eight projects have been shortlisted from the first EOI,65 and the second EOI was issued in May 2025 
for the next batch of solutions.66 In February 2025, the IT Ministry also announced the launch of an 
AI safety institute (AISI) under this pillar. The IndiaAI AISI will serve as the national anchor institution 
for advancing safe and trusted AI by developing governance frameworks, driving research on AI risk 
mitigation, fostering cross-sector collaboration, and supporting both domestic and international 
efforts to ensure responsible AI development and deployment.

Data protection and privacy laws
India achieved a score of 98.49 out of 100 and secured Tier-1 status (score of 95–100) 
on the International Telecommunication Union (ITU’s) Global Cybersecurity Index, 
2024 (Figure 2). Tier-1, categorized as role-modelling, reflects the highest level of 
cybersecurity preparedness.67
India enacted the Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA) on 11 August 2023.68 The DPDPA 
replaces the earlier Information Technology (Reasonable security practices and procedures and 
sensitive personal data or information) Rules, 2011 (also known as SPDI rules)69 and aims to safeguard 
digital personal data while balancing innovation, user rights and public interest. India’s Data Protection 
Act has been shaped by a decade of legal and policy developments, including a 2017 Supreme Court 
ruling70 that recognized privacy as a fundamental right, and a 2018 expert committee report on 
personal data protection.71 In November 2025, the Government notified the Digital Personal Data 
Protection (DPDP) Rules, marking the operationalization of the Act.72
The DPDPA provides individuals, referred to as data principals, with control over their personal data. 
It grants the right to access, correct, update and erase personal data once the purpose of collection 
is fulfilled.73 Individuals also have the right to withdraw consent at any time.74 Central to the law is 
a notice-and-consent framework that requires data fiduciaries (entities processing personal data) to 
issue clear, accessible and multilingual notices detailing the nature and purpose of data processing, the 
rights of individuals, and available grievance redress mechanisms.75 Given India’s linguistic diversity, 
the multilingual requirement is intended to facilitate user comprehension. Consent is defined as free, 
informed, specific, unambiguous and not conditional on unrelated terms.76 The Act also introduces the 
concept of consent managers (data trusts) that will serve as independent, registered entities enabling 
individuals to manage, review and revoke their data-sharing consent across multiple platforms in 
a secure manner.77
The DPDP Rules set out the operational requirements for implementing the DPDP Act. They introduce 
detailed obligations on consent notices, security safeguards, data-breach reporting, children’s data, 
retention, cross-border transfers and the responsibilities of Significant Data Fiduciaries. The Rules also 
establish the registration and governance framework for consent managers, outline how government 
departments may process personal data for public services, and clarify timelines for phased compliance. 
Together, the Act and the Rules provide India’s overarching structure for personal data governance, 
balancing individual rights and accountability measures for data fiduciaries.

The law codifies privacy principles such as purpose limitation, storage limitation, transparency and 
data minimization. These obligations are operationalized through provisions that require fiduciaries 
to process only data necessary for a specified purpose, and to delete it once that purpose is achieved.78 
Sector-specific guidelines, such as a proposed three-year data retention cap for e-commerce and 
social media platforms, are also under consideration. The Act also requires significant data fiduciaries 
(entities classified by the government based on volume, sensitivity of data, risks to rights of users, and 
security of state) to conduct periodic impact assessments and audits, and appoint a data protection 
officer who will be the point of contact for grievance redressal, periodic Data Protection Impact 
Assessments (DPIAs), audits and other measures.79 These obligations do not apply to general data 
fiduciaries.
The DPDPA does not distinguish sensitive personal data such as health, biometric or financial 
information from other forms of personal data, bringing all personal data under a single standard 
of protection. Enforcement of the Act is overseen by the Data Protection Board of India (DPBI), an 
independent body empowered to investigate complaints, direct corrective measures, and impose 
penalties of up to INR 250 crore (approximately USD 28 million).80

### Page 34

The Act applies to both private and public sector entities. However, the Central Government is 
empowered to exempt ‘instrumentalities of the State’ from certain obligations under the law in the 
interest of national security and public order, or for delivering subsidies and public services.81
Beyond statutory law, the constitutional status of privacy in India remains rooted in the 2017 Supreme 
Court Ruling82 that held that privacy includes personal autonomy, family life, home, marriage and 
sexual orientation. Together, the DPDPA and constitutional jurisprudence form the building blocks 
of India’s evolving personal data governance regime, which is expected to impact the development, 
deployment and use of AI systems.
Data sharing and accessibility 
The Open Data Inventory 2024 by Open Data Watch ranks India 106th of 197 countries, with an 
overall score of 54 out of 100. India scores 52 on overall coverage and 55 on openness, with economic 
statistic sub-scores at 63 compared to 45 for social statistics sub-scores.83 While India has not signed 
the international Open Data Charter, several policy frameworks and institutional initiatives have been 
launched to advance open data practices domestically.
India has a national data sharing framework in place through its National Data Sharing and 
Accessibility Policy (NDSAP), 2012, which mandates all ministries, departments and public agencies 
to release shareable and non-sensitive data in publicly accessible formats.84 The policy is underpinned 
by principles of openness, transparency and interoperability, and classifies government data as either 
open, restricted or limited-access. It affirms that data ownership remains with the originating agency 
and mandates that shareable datasets be made available on the Open Government Data (OGD) 
platform.85 The platform hosts a central repository of over 480,000 datasets with 12,457 catalogues of 
similar datasets across sectors including health, education, agriculture, transport and public finance.86 
Further, the NDSAP implementation guidelines provide a data management process that government 
departments can use to publish their datasets through a predefined workflow.87 The guidelines require 
government departments to appoint chief data officers, who nominate data contributors responsible 
for publishing datasets and metadata on the OGD platform.88 Chief data officers ensure data quality, 
approve publication and oversee processes for standardization, including specifying tools and formats 
such as CSV, JSON and XML.89
While there has not been a formal assessment of the data sharing policy and the OGD, the government 
released a working paper in January 2025, assessing public data dissemination portals.90 The paper 
suggests changes to certain features of these portals including accessibility, scalability, modularity, 
search functions, metadata availability, data visualization, open data policy and user-centricity.91
To increase access to high-quality India-specific datasets for AI research and development,92 the 
IT Ministry launched AIKosh in March 2025, under the India Datasets Pillar of the IndiaAI Mission.93 A core 
objective of the platform is to ensure that the datasets contributed align with ethical AI principles that 
enable responsible and transparent AI development.94 It requires all contributions to have appropriate 
rights and permissions to share datasets, and any personal or sensitive data included to be properly 
anonymized. It also prohibits users from engaging in conduct that may be defamatory, harassment, 
intellectual property infringement, malware dissemination or identity deception. Content or accounts 
found violating these terms may be removed or suspended.95 In March 2025, the IT Ministry issued an 
Expression of Interest inviting non-governmental actors to contribute anonymized datasets to the 
AIKosh platform.96

### Page 35

Under the IndiaAI Mission, Data Curation Units (DCUs) are being set up as a structured pathway for 
ministries to curate and share non-personal government datasets specifically for AI training and 
development (not inferencing). Currently being operationalized across nine ministries, the initiative 
aims to scale to fifty ministries by end-2027, with curated datasets hosted through AIKosh to enable 
discoverability and secure access. An early example is AgriKosh, to be hosted within AIKosh to 
accelerate agriculture-focused AI innovation. At its core, the DCU model seeks to build an interoperable 
data architecture across government – reducing fragmented, siloed data practices and making public 
datasets more readily usable.
India’s data governance efforts, while primarily focused on the public sector, are gradually incorporating 
trust-based sharing models with the private sector. The ‘account aggregator’ framework, established 
by the Reserve Bank of India, enables user-authorized sharing of financial data between licensed 
‘financial information providers’ and ‘financial information users’. It is designed to operate through 
regulated intermediaries (account aggregators) that facilitate encrypted, purpose-limited data 
transfers without retaining or processing the data themselves.97
Separately, India’s Data Protection Act introduces the concept of consent managers – entities 
responsible for enabling individuals to manage, monitor and withdraw their consent for data 
sharing across digital services. Consent managers are required to operate in a manner that ensures 
transparency and accountability in personal data flows.98 The Smart Cities Mission, under the Ministry 
of Housing and Urban Affairs, also recognized the importance of user-data rights in its AI Playbook for 
Cities, and called for instituting data stewardship mechanisms.99 Alongside, India’s skilling ecosystem 
has formally recognized the role of AI ‘data stewards’ through an occupational standard published by 
the National Skill Development Corporation in 2019. The standard outlines key competencies related 
to data quality, compliance and life-cycle management.100
Procurement laws and policies
Currently, India does not have a dedicated national law or policy specifically governing the procurement 
of AI systems or services. Procurements are primarily regulated under the General Financial Rules, 2017, 
which provide the overarching framework for all government purchases, including those involving 
software and technology transfers. Under these rules, AI systems are typically procured under the 
broad category of ‘goods’, encompassing software, hardware and technology-related services.101
In its Approach Document for India: Part 2 – Operationalizing Principles for Responsible AI, NITI Aayog 
recommended the development of model guidelines for AI procurement in the public sector.102 
Highlighting procurement of AI systems as an important area of examination by the government, 
it noted that while platforms like the Government e-Marketplace103 have improved transparency in 
public procurement, the complexity of AI demands sector-specific trust indicators, risk assessment 
tools, and institutional mechanisms to guide responsible procurement. The report also called for the 
establishment of expert review committees to evaluate high-risk AI projects to ensure they are aligned 
with principles of transparency, accountability and fairness, without adding excessive regulatory 
burdens or causing administrative delays.104 Subsequently, in its 2022 report on responsible AI in 
facial recognition technology (FRT), it advised that public procurement of high-risk technologies such 
as FRT follow transparent, problem-driven requests for proposals, complete with risk assessments, 
vendor responsibilities for bias and error- rate disclosures, and clear data-governance terms. It urged 
prioritizing regular independent monitoring.105

In 2024, the IndiaAI Mission issued technical and financial empanelment guidelines for onboarding 
service providers to deliver AI solutions over cloud infrastructure. These guidelines outline eligibility 
criteria, pricing structures and quality benchmarks for AI vendors, including requirements for user-
level access controls and administrator logs to enable auditability.106
Similarly, the Smart Cities Mission has issued non-binding frameworks to support city administrations 
in adopting and procuring AI-driven solutions. Its AI Playbook for Cities references the responsible 
AI principles set out in NITI Aayog’s National Strategy on AI (2018), but does not explicitly embed 
these principles into procurement practices. It also notes the absence of model guidelines for AI 
procurement.107 Subsequently, the Smart Cities Mission launched the Smart Procure Guidelines, which 
establish a structured procurement process through the City Innovation Exchange platform.108 These 
guidelines focus on technical and efficiency evaluation measures but do not explicitly incorporate 
ethical or rights-based criteria into the evaluation process.109 At the state level, some jurisdictions have 
taken proactive steps to develop tailored frameworks. Some state governments have also started 
developing AI-specific procurement guidelines.110
The evaluation and certification of AI systems in India currently focuses more on technical robustness 
versus ethical or human rights dimensions. International standards such as ISO/IEC 42001:2023 
(AI Management Systems) and ISO/IEC 23894:2023 (AI Risk Management) are beginning to gain 
traction among stakeholders, with Indian entities participating in international standard- setting 
bodies and private firms exploring certification pathways.111 However, it remains unclear whether 
these certifications are actively considered in public procurement, as there is no central mandate 
or oversight mechanism requiring AI vendors or solutions to be certified before engagement. As of 
December 2025, there is no official registry of certified AI vendors maintained by the government, but 
recent efforts reflect a growing recognition of the need to embed ethics and safety into accountable 
AI procurement.
Freedom of information/access to knowledge Acts
With the growing use of AI in public services across India, ensuring transparency in how these 
systems are developed, procured and deployed becomes critical. Enacted in 2005, the Right to 
Information Act, 2005 (RTI Act)112 grants citizens the right to access public information from statutory 
and government owned/funded bodies. While the RTI Act does not mention AI specifically, it can be 
used to uncover how public institutions are incorporating AI technologies. Individuals can potentially 
seek information on the use of AI in public services, including details about algorithms, training data, 
decision-making processes and governance guardrails. The RTI Act excludes certain categories of 
information from its ambit, which include data held by intelligence and security agencies, information 
that may affect national security or foreign relations, trade secrets or intellectual property that could 
harm the competitive position of third parties, and personal data where disclosure would constitute 
an unwarranted invasion of privacy. The RTI Act permits disclosure if the public interest outweighs 
the potential harm. The decision to share information rests with the public authority, with a detailed 
appeals process allowing for judicial review.113
The Data Protection Act casts a binding legal obligation on all entities, including government 
organizations, that process personal data to inform individuals about how their data is being collected, 
used and shared. For government processing, this obligation applies unless the Central Government 
issues a specific exemption for national security reasons and for certain defined State functions.114
Further, independent regulators like SEBI have mandated research analysts and entities to disclose to 
their clients the extent of their use of AI tools in providing research services.115

### Page 37

Due process and accountability
The IT Act serves as India’s overarching legal framework governing digital technologies, including 
AI systems.116 The IT Act penalizes offences such as unauthorized access, cyber-attacks, identity theft 
and fraud, with provisions for fines and imprisonment. The Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media 
Ethics Code (IDMEC) Rules, notified under the IT Act, require digital platforms to establish grievance 
redressal mechanisms, appoint grievance officers, and respond to user complaints within specified 
timeframes. Sectoral regulators have also established accountability standards within their respective 
domains. For instance, SEBI allows its regulated entities to use AI systems while maintaining that 
ultimate responsibility remains with the regulated entities for data protection, AI outputs and legal 
compliance, whether tools are built in-house or externally sourced.117 The Reserve Bank of India has 
also released a FREE-AI Committee Report, which outlines principles and safeguards for responsible AI 
use in the financial sector.118
Online safety and integrity of speech
The Indian Constitution permits reasonable restrictions on freedom of speech and expression on 
limited grounds such as public order, decency, morality, sovereignty and security of the state, and 
defamation.119 The IT Act, along with its associated rules, provides a legal framework for the regulation 
and removal of unlawful online content. Section 69A of the IT Act empowers the IT Ministry to issue 
blocking orders as per the procedure provided in the 2009 Blocking Rules.120 Additionally, the 2021 
IDMEC Rules empower the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting to take down news and current 
affairs content, and online curated content such as content on over-the-top (OTT) platforms subject 
to certain procedural safeguards.121
Under the Blocking Rules, the government may appoint a designated officer to receive requests from 
government agencies for blocking certain content.122 These requests are reviewed by a committee 
comprising the designated officer as its chairperson and representatives from the Ministry of Law 
and Justice, the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (forming 
a Review Committee).123 If the Review Committee finds the content to be in violation of existing 
laws, it may recommend that access be restricted. In emergency situations, content may be blocked 
immediately, subject to post-facto review by the Review Committee.124
Under the IDMEC Rules, intermediaries are required to take down unlawful content within 36 hours 
of receiving a court/government order.125 Failure to do so may result in the intermediary being liable 
for the unlawful content.126 This take-down framework applies to any information that is harmful to 
children; promotes enmity between groups on grounds such as religion or caste with intent to incite 
violence; deceives or misleads recipients about the origin of a message; knowingly and intentionally 
communicates misinformation or patently false and untrue or misleading information; threatens 
the unity, integrity, defence, security or sovereignty of India; affects public order; or violates any law 
currently in force. These obligations form part of the broader framework under Section 79 of the IT 
Act and its associated rules, which offer conditional immunity to intermediaries while requiring them 
to follow due-diligence standards for content moderation, user safety and cooperation with lawful 
requests.
In 2023, the IT Ministry issued an advisory highlighting the dangers of AI and deepfake technology on 
user safety and emphasized the need to regulate harms.127 Directed at platforms, it reinforced existing 
provisions of law to tackle misinformation and deepfakes. Similarly, in 2024, the Indian Computer 
Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) also released an advisory on deepfakes and mitigation 
strategies.128

### Page 38

Obligations on online intermediaries
The obligations of intermediaries are outlined in the IDMEC Rules. Intermediaries are required to 
make reasonable efforts to prevent the transmission of unlawful content on their platforms, including 
misinformation, obscene material, paedophilic content, patently false or misleading information, 
and content that infringes intellectual property or other rights.129 The IDMEC Rules also prescribe 
due diligence requirements, such as publishing terms of use and privacy policies in English and the 
user’s preferred Indian language, taking steps to prevent harmful content, and appointing grievance 
officers to address user complaints within 15 days (or 72 hours in case of more severe violations).130 
Intermediaries with more than 5 million registered users, designated as significant social media 
intermediaries (SSMIs), are subject to additional obligations. These include deploying automated tools 
or other technology-based measures to proactively detect content depicting or simulating sexually 
abusive material, including child sexual abuse material.131
Existing regulatory frameworks govern issues related to transparency, misinformation, disinformation 
and hate speech online. In addition, the IT Ministry has initiated steps to address AI-generated 
content, including the proposed amendments to the IDMEC Rules regarding synthetically generated 
information, which introduce obligations for labelling and embedding permanent identifiers in 
synthetically generated content, and mandates significant social media intermediaries to collect and 
verify user declarations for such content. Under the Safe and Trusted AI pillar of the IndiaAI Mission, the 
IT Ministry is supporting AI research projects aimed at developing techno-legal tools for identifying 
fake speech and deepfakes.132
Public sector capacity
India has institutionalized training and upskilling programmes for public sector officials through 
several national initiatives, recognizing the need for a digitally competent bureaucracy in the 
age of AI. The Competency Framework for AI Integration in India, launched in March 2025 by the 
IndiaAI Mission, specifically addresses the need to build AI literacy, ethical awareness and sectoral 
expertise among officials involved in planning, procuring or deploying AI systems.133 It outlines core 
behavioural, functional and domain-specific competencies needed to navigate the AI life cycle, such as 
understanding AI technologies, managing data and ensuring accountability, and sectoral knowledge 
in areas like healthcare, agriculture and education.
This AI-specific initiative complements broader public administration training programmes like the 
National Programme for Civil Services Capacity Building (NPCSCB), also known as Mission Karmayogi.134 
Core to the overall institutional framework of Mission Karmayogi, the Capacity Building Commission 
(CBC), established in April 2021, is a three-member independent body that drives at harmonization 
across public sector learning and the development landscape. The NPCSCB is administered by 
the Department of Personnel and Training under the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and 
Pensions. Through its digital platform, iGOT Karmayogi, over 200,000 officials have already accessed 
courses on AI, blockchain and emerging technologies.135 While there is currently no mandatory policy 
requiring all new public employees to undergo AI-specific training, these platforms institutionalize 
continuous learning and have created pathways for both optional and role-specific digital upskilling.

CHAPTER 3
Social and cultural dimension
The social and cultural dimension of the RAM outlines how inclusion, diversity, public awareness and 
environmental considerations shape the development and deployment of AI systems. In the Indian 
context, these priorities are closely linked to the government’s AI for All vision, which aims to ensure 
that the benefits of AI reach all segments of society. This vision informs national strategies on digital 
infrastructure, public service delivery, and research and skilling, with a focus on equitable access and 
participation.136
This chapter outlines measures taken to address disparities in access to technology across gender 
and geographic lines. It examines efforts to involve women and marginalized communities in the 
digital economy. A 25 per cent gender gap in internet access persists,137 highlighting challenges in 
providing digital connectivity. This chapter also explores gender representation in science, technology, 
engineering and mathematics (STEM) education and the broader AI workforce. Public engagement 
with digital platforms and trust in AI systems, including perceptions of fairness and data use, are 
discussed as indicators of public acceptance. It also reviews the integration of AI into healthcare and 
disability services, and the impact of AI tools on children. Finally, this dimension reviews initiatives 
supporting linguistic and cultural diversity through AI, as well as national- and state-level approaches 
to environmental sustainability in AI infrastructure.
Diversity, inclusion and equality
India’s digital landscape shows varying levels of access to the 
internet across demographics, with internet penetration of 
406.97 million in rural areas and 563.19 million in urban areas.138 
India’s gender gap in internet use stands at 0.74 (with 1 indicating 
parity), i.e. for every 100 men online there are approximately 
74 women online.139 As per international indices, the gender 
gap in internet access in India is 25.6 per cent, and the gender 
gap in mobile phone access is 14.3 per cent.140
While connectivity has expanded in recent years, many women, especially in rural and underserved 
areas, continue to face limitations related to device ownership and digital skills.141 These patterns are 
influenced by education levels, income, geographic location and social norms, making digital inclusion 
an area that requires coordinated and context-specific efforts. The Comprehensive Modular Survey: 
Telecom, 2025, undertaken by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, surveyed 
142,065 people and found that despite 76.3 per cent of rural women using mobile phones, only 
48.4 per cent of them owned the device. In contrast, 89.5 per cent of rural men used mobile phones, 
with 80.7 per cent owning them.142
The government has implemented programmes to promote women’s digital literacy. The Pradhan 
Mantri Gramin Digital Saksharta Abhiyan (PMGDISHA), a flagship Digital India scheme launched in 
2017, aims to make one person per rural household digitally literate, with a strong focus on women’s 
inclusion.143 The IT for Masses programme operated by the Ministry of Electronics and Information 
Technology (IT Ministry) funds information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure, 
digital tools and training specifically for groups such as women, persons with disabilities and senior 
citizens, with the aim to narrow the digital divide through capacity building and entrepreneurship 
support. Under the programme, 556,000 women, 112,000 persons from scheduled castes and 59,000

aimed at enabling digital access, skills training and entrepreneurship opportunities for communities 
that have historically been left out of the digital economy. Complementing this, the National Policy 
for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship146 and the Skill India Mission,147 both launched in 2015, 
emphasize the need for skilling people from geographical and socially disadvantaged backgrounds 
and marginalized communities, to build a more inclusive and future-ready workforce.

Diversity in STEM
As per the Global Gender Gap Report 2025, 23.05 per cent of all female graduates and 31.43 per cent of 
all male graduates in India were in STEM fields.148 As per data provided in a parliamentary response by 
the Minister for Science and Technology, women make up 43 per cent of enrolment in STEMM (STEM 
plus medicine) fields in higher education.149 However, India’s proportion of women scientists is only 
18.6 per cent, and only 25 per cent of research and development (R&D) projects are run by women 
scientists.150
Various government programmes aim to build an early-stage pipeline of women in STEM. For example, 
the Vigyan Jyoti scheme targets meritorious girls from Grades 9 to 12 to pursue STEM through science 
camps, special lectures, role model interactions and visits to partner institutions like the Indian 
Institutes of Technology (IITs), National Institutes of Technology (NITs), etc.151 In 2022, 30,000 girls 
across 200 districts were enrolled in the Vigyan Jyoti programme.152 Programmes like the Consolidation 
of University Research for Innovation and Excellence (CURIE) also support research infrastructure in 
women’s universities.153 In 2024, 22 women’s postgraduate colleges were selected to receive support 
from the Department of Science & Technology (DST) under the third call of the CURIE-PG component, 
to enhance research and innovation.154 In addition, under the CURIE-AI initiative launched in 2019, 
AI facilities have been set up in six women’s universities with funding of INR 4.2 crore (approximately 
USD 470,600),155 to help bridge the gender gap. Additionally, SERB-POWER (Science and Engineering 
Research Board- Promoting Opportunities for Women in Exploratory Research)156 funds research led 
by women scientists; Gender Advancement for Transforming Institutions (GATI) seeks to create an

enabling environment for equal participation of women in STEMM disciplines at all levels;157 while the 
Women Scientist Scheme provides fellowships for women returning to scientific careers after a break.158 
In addition to these national efforts, various Indian states have also undertaken initiatives to bridge 
the digital gender divide by distributing smartphones to rural women and college students,159 
establishing state-led incubators to promote women’s entrepreneurship,160 and imparting skills to 
enable women to run village-scale businesses.161 Apart from government efforts, non-governmental 
organizations and private sector actors have launched a range of digital inclusion initiatives aimed 
at bridging the gender gap in access to technology and digital skills.162 These efforts also extend to 
promoting job readiness support to improve women’s entry into AI-related roles.
At present, companies and universities are not mandatorily required to publish diversity statistics. 
However, the government has consistently emphasized the need to implement inclusivity through 
AI design, development and deployment phases.163 As host of the AI Impact Summit 2026, India is 
introducing programmes such as AI by Her, centred on women’s participation in AI, with ‘Inclusion 
for Social Empowerment’ as a core theme.164 Additionally, in 2024, the Ministry of Education issued 
guidelines on public self-disclosure by higher education institutions (HEIs).165 Although HEIs are not 
required to publish diversity statistics, these guidelines push for greater transparency in university 
operations, such as admissions, faculty composition, administration, research cells, etc.166
Indigenous language training
In 2022, the IT Ministry launched Bhashini, an AI-powered language platform, to enable citizens to 
access digital services in their native languages.167 Bhashini aims to bridge the digital, literacy and 
language divide by creating innovative, voice-first, multilingual solutions that enable seamless 
communication and access to digital services in multiple Indian languages. The platform also facilitates 
the crowdsourcing of linguistic inputs through an initiative called BhashaDaan, which invites citizens 
to contribute to an open repository of language data.168 This repository is intended to support the 
digital enablement of diverse Indian languages by enhancing datasets for natural language processing 
(NLP) applications.
Bhashini currently supports linguistic inclusion in twenty-two languages across a growing number 
of government digital interfaces.169 For example, Indian Railways upgraded its RailMadad portal with 
Bhashini’s multilingual text and speech recognition technology, enabling users to lodge grievances, 
track bookings and make inquiries in their preferred Indian languages. This offers accessibility to 
over 200 million citizens, using voice commands.170 Additionally, a PM-KISAN app was built by the 
National Informatics Centre to provide real-time support and information on government schemes, 
crop insurance and financial assistance to farmers in their preferred languages, leveraging Bhashini.171
Project Vaani, a joint initiative by the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) and the AI & Robotics Technology 
Park (ARTPARK)172 is creating datasets spanning 86 languages across 22 states by collecting data from 
about 1 million people across 773 districts of India.173 The project aims to build a large-scale dataset of 
over 150,000 hours of speech, with a portion transcribed in local scripts.
IIT Madras’ AI4Bharat Lab seeks to advance AI technology for Indian languages through open-source 
contributions. It has developed multilingual large language models (LLMs) tailored for Indic languages, 
including IndicBERT,174 IndicBART175 and Airavata,176 trained on diverse datasets.177 Two of the Lab’s 
notable projects are Chitralekha and Everest 1.0. Chitralekha is an open-source video transcreation 
platform that enables users to generate and edit audio transcripts in various Indic languages.178 
Everest 1.0 is a multilingual AI system that supports thirty-five Indian languages, with plans to expand 
to ninety.179

Private Indian companies are also focusing on AI development in indigenous languages and are 
undertaking efforts to build representative datasets from low-resource regions.180
Public engagement and trust
India ranks 18th of 100 countries globally in public trust in government websites and mobile 
applications, with 62.7 per cent of respondents expressing confidence in these platforms, as per 
the Inclusive Internet Index 2022.181 Further, as per the Institut Public de Sondage d’Opinion Secteu 
(IPSOS) AI Monitor 2024, on AI-specific trust, 60 per cent of urban Indian respondents report trust in 
companies using AI to handle personal data, and 63 per cent believe AI systems are unlikely to exhibit 
bias or discrimination. Additionally, 62 per cent agree that the benefits of AI outweigh its potential 
risks, indicating a relatively high level of public comfort with AI technologies compared to global 
averages.182
The development of foundational digital systems, such as Aadhaar (India’s digital identity infrastructure) 
and the unified payments interface (UPI), has played a key role in expanding access to digital public 
services while also fostering user confidence in their reliability, security and effectiveness. This has 
contributed to greater digital adoption among Indian citizens, with studies indicating that 80 per cent 
of digital retail payments in the country are now made through UPI.183
India’s position in global e-governance rankings also reflects broad levels of digital engagement. 
In 2024, the country’s Online Service Index score, which evaluates digital citizen engagement across 
parameters like access to information, consultation and participation, stood at 0.8184, signalling well-
developed digital infrastructure to promote access and inclusion.184 As per a national survey conducted 
in 2022, 74 per cent of citizens surveyed said they were satisfied with the digital services available to 
them, especially in areas like finance and local utilities.185 Further, India ranks 61st of 193 countries on 
the E-Participation Index, with a score of 0.6575, well above the global average of 0.4893.186

Environment and sustainability policies
Currently, India does not have a dedicated policy to address the environmental impact of AI or its 
implications for sustainability. A Draft Data Centre Policy (2020), issued by the IT Ministry, encouraged 
the use of renewable energy for data centres but did not outline specific environmental safeguards 
related to land use, water consumption or emissions.187 India has also established a Centre of Excellence 
(CoE) on sustainable cities to develop AI-driven solutions for urban environmental challenges. Led by 
IIT Kanpur, the CoE focuses on applications such as energy forecasting, air quality monitoring, urban 
flood management and digital twins for city planning.188 While not a substitute for a comprehensive 
AI environment policy, the CoE reflects growing institutional efforts to align AI innovation with the 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
India has made high-level international commitments that include environmental objectives, such as 
endorsing the Paris Declaration on Sustainable AI.189 Domestically, the India AI Governance Guidelines 
explicitly state that ‘AI development efforts should be ‘environmentally responsible and resource-
efficient’.190 A key theme of the upcoming AI Impact Summit in 2026, which India will host, is to harness 
AI for a resilient and sustainable planet.
India’s 2070 net-zero commitment provides a broad sustainability framework, while AI-specific 
environmental requirements are still in the process of emerging. Additionally, India does not have 
a specific legal mandate for specialized environmental impact assessments (EIA) applicable to AI 
deployments. Software-based AI systems and related digital infrastructure, such as server farms and 
data centres, are not listed under the EIA notification by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and 
Climate Change (MoEFCC, or Environment Ministry), which governs clearance requirements for major 
projects. While such facilities must comply with local land use and pollution control norms, specific 
EIA requirements triggered solely by the use or deployment of AI technologies are not available.191
Indian companies are subject to its capital market regulator’s ‘business responsibility and sustainability 
reporting’ requirements, which mandate disclosures on energy consumption, renewable energy 
usage, greenhouse gas emissions and water use.192 While these reports do not disaggregate data for 
AI, digital infrastructure, including that used for AI, is included in overall corporate environmental 
disclosures. Recent state-level policies have also focused on sustainability. This includes financial 
support for setting up green buildings in data infrastructure projects193 and reimbursements for 
upgrading to energy-efficient equipment and technologies.194
Health and social well-being
India has adopted multiple legal, policy and institutional frameworks to guide the integration of 
digital technologies, including AI, into its healthcare system. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare 
(Health Ministry), in collaboration with associated bodies such as the Indian Council of Medical 
Research (ICMR) and the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO), leads this effort 
through national policies and regulatory guidelines. While there is no stand-alone, AI-specific health 
policy, various instruments address the use of AI within broader digital health frameworks. In previous 
policy documents, healthcare was identified as one of five priority sectors for AI adoption.
Policy and regulatory frameworks for AI in health
In 2017, the Health Ministry released the National Health Policy, laying the foundation for technology 
integration in healthcare by advocating for digital tools to enhance service efficiency and outcomes.195

### Page 45

32
It recommended the development of integrated health information systems, the establishment of 
a federated national health information architecture, the expansion of teleconsultation services, and 
the creation of registries to support public health analytics.196
Building on this, the National Digital Health Blueprint (2019) presented a framework to achieve universal 
health coverage through digital infrastructure.197 It identified AI and machine learning (ML) as key 
enablers for service delivery, especially in rural areas, and proposed the establishment of a unified health 
communication system capable of deploying AI tools for public health emergency management.198 
The Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM), launched in 2020, operationalizes the architecture 
proposed in the 2019 blueprint.199 The ABDM creates a national framework for digital health records 
and registries, with interoperability standards.200 As of February 2025, over 739.8 million digital health 
IDs have been created, with more than 564,000 medical professionals and 363,000 verified health 
facilities enrolled.201 The National Health Authority202 and IIT Kanpur have collaborated to develop 
a federated learning platform to support AI model development in healthcare, including a consent 
management framework for research use cases under the ABDM.203
From a regulatory perspective, the Medical Devices Rules, 2017,204 issued under the Drugs and 
Cosmetics Act and administered by CDSCO, cover the approval and classification of software-based 
medical devices.205 In 2021, CDSCO published a notification listing sixty categories of software, including 
AI-powered diagnostic imaging tools, to be regulated as medical devices.206
The Telemedicine Practice Guidelines (2020) define the scope of remote consultations and permit the 
use of AI tools for clinical support, provided that any diagnosis or prescription is made or verified by 
a registered medical practitioner. These guidelines clarify that AI may assist in but not independently 
carry out diagnostic or therapeutic functions.207
The Ethical Guidelines for Application of AI in Biomedical Research and Healthcare,208 issued by the 
ICMR, set out ten non-binding principles to guide AI research and development. These principles are: 
accountability, autonomy, data privacy, collaboration, risk minimization, accessibility, equity, non-
discrimination, data quality, and validity. The guidelines recommend continuous human oversight 
and advocate for testing AI systems across diverse demographic groups.209
AI integration in public health service delivery
AI applications are being introduced in both public and private sectors to support clinical care, 
diagnostics and digital service delivery. In the area of physical health, AI technologies are used for 
diagnostic imaging, early disease detection, and clinical decision support, such as tools developed 
for early-stage screening of conditions like breast cancer,210 AI-assisted fracture detection and bone 
surgery,211 and non-invasive physiological analysis for chronic disease risk.212 Deployment typically 
occurs through cloud-based platforms and device-integrated systems in hospitals and primary 
healthcare settings.
In public health delivery, AI and digital technologies are integrated through nationwide service 
platforms. The e-Sanjeevani telemedicine system, developed by the Health Ministry, enables remote 
consultations across states and union territories.213 This platform also underpins the National Tele 
Mental Health Programme (Tele-MANAS), which connects district-level mental health services to 
a centralized digital network. More than 2 million calls have been handled by 53 Tele-MANAS cells set 
up across states and union territories (UTs),214 with services available in 20 languages.215
The government has also launched a Centre of Excellence for AI in Healthcare, established through 
a partnership between AIIMS Delhi and IIT Delhi.216 Backed by an INR 330 crore (approximately USD

36.97 million) grant under the central government’s Make AI in India, Make AI Work for India initiative, 
this CoE aims to develop indigenous AI tools to support key national health programmes. It will serve 
as a central research and resource hub focused on improving healthcare accessibility, upskilling 
providers, and integrating AI into India’s public health systems, especially for underserved and remote 
populations.
In the private sector, developers have introduced AI-supported applications for mental health,217 
including digital screening tools, cognitive behavioural therapy platforms,218 and voice-based 
counselling assistants.219 These tools are available via mobile applications, web-based platforms and 
immersive environments, and are used in both clinical and individual user contexts.
AI for accessibility and persons with disabilities
AI is increasingly being deployed in India to develop accessible and assistive solutions for persons 
with disabilities (PwDs), moving beyond physical infrastructure to address digital inclusion. In 2025, 
the Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities launched key national initiatives to 
embed AI into assistive technologies and streamline access to public services for PwDs, specifically, 
Mission AI Accessibility, a national disability support AI chatbot, and a unified benefits interface.220
In May 2025, the government launched a voice and WhatsApp-based AI-enabled chatbot, developed 
with an Indian generative AI start up, to help PwDs access information on government schemes 
more easily.221 Alongside, three memoranda of understanding were signed by the Department of 
Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities to expand the use of AI in empowering PwDs through 
targeted digital interventions such as using an AI-powered mobile platform to disseminate 
personalized, accessible information related to legal rights, government benefits and grievance 
redressal; improving AI-powered guidance tools that help PwDs determine their eligibility for central 
and state welfare schemes; and making thousands of key government documents (policy guidelines, 
legal decisions and official orders) available in accessible formats for persons with visual disabilities.222 
Another example of AI being used to advance inclusion is Swarajability, India’s first AI-based job 
platform for PwDs, launched by IIT Hyderabad, to support persons with visual, hearing and/or 
locomotive disabilities access employment opportunities, particularly in the tech sector.223 Together, 
these developments reflect a growing policy and innovation focus on using AI as a driver of systemic 
inclusion, enabling PwDs to access information, services and opportunities with greater autonomy 
and dignity.
Impact of AI on children’s health
Institutional efforts to explore the impact of AI technologies on children’s health have been initiated. 
The ICMR, through its ethical guidelines on AI in biomedical research, highlights the need to pay 
special attention to vulnerable groups, including children,224 involved in AI system design or testing.225 
These guidelines recommend that the inclusion of such groups be justified and that AI models be 
tested for reliability across varied population segments, including age.226 The recent AI Governance 
Guidelines issued by the IT Ministry also highlight the need for heightened protection of vulnerable 
groups like children, noting that AI systems, and particularly recommendation algorithms, can affect 
children’s mental well-being by prioritizing engagement over developmental needs.227 The guidelines 
call for an India-specific risk-assessment and classification framework to guide appropriate safeguards 
for child safety. The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) has also launched a research project to examine 
the psychological impacts of AI on different user groups, with the aim of informing ethical guidance 
and future standards for AI systems.228

### Page 47

34
AI is also being deployed in public health efforts aimed at children. The Ministry of Women and Child 
Development has piloted an AI-based tool that enables frontline workers to track child growth in 
real time using smartphone video capture, improving accuracy and enabling the early detection of 
malnutrition.229 Further, a Poshan tracker platform uses AI to monitor health, nutrition and service 
delivery for children aged 0–6 years, across government-supported childcare centres (known as 
Anganwadi centres) helping strengthen frontline care systems.230
Culture
Given the depth of India’s history and its extensive linguistic, artistic and cultural diversity, digital 
technologies, including AI, offer scalable tools for the documentation, management and dissemination 
of cultural heritage. While India has not adopted a dedicated policy focused exclusively on the use of 
AI for cultural preservation, several national initiatives incorporate digital components that enable 
aspects of this work. These include documentation of manuscripts, digitization of cultural resources, 
and limited applications of AI in museum settings and archival projects. The Ministry of Culture leads 
many of these efforts through programmes that embed digital technologies into broader cultural 
policy frameworks.
The National Mission on Cultural Mapping, administered by the Ministry of Culture, aims to digitally 
record and map cultural assets across the country.231 Although the policy does not explicitly refer to 
AI, it promotes the use of advanced digital technologies for cultural documentation at the grassroots 
level. The National Mission for Manuscripts supports the conservation, digitization and dissemination 
of India’s manuscript heritage. As of July 2024, it has established over 100 manuscripts resource 
centres and conservation centres across India. Approximately 350,000 manuscripts, comprising 
nearly 35 million pages, have been digitized under this mission.232 The National Virtual Library of India 
provides open access to a large repository of digitized cultural content, including rare books, historical 
documents and images.233
Public museums such as the National Museum in Delhi have begun using AI-powered chatbots to 
improve visitor interaction by providing contextual information about artefacts on display.234 Private 
museums have also developed AI-based platforms to connect and contextualize South Asian textiles, 
linking them to related global artefacts. This initiative enriches cultural heritage by providing detailed 
metadata and facilitating a global understanding of South Asian textile traditions.235
While the Ministry of Culture publishes periodic reports on the progress of these programmes, there 
is limited publicly available data on formal evaluations assessing the impact or effectiveness of these 
digital or AI-related interventions.236
Community participation in AI development for cultural heritage
Opportunities for community participation in the development of AI technologies related to cultural 
heritage remain limited. Most existing initiatives focus on enabling communities to contribute 
content, with less emphasis on their involvement in the design, regulation or oversight of AI systems. 
One example of community participation in this context is the Mera Gaon Meri Dharohar initiative, 
launched under the Culture Mapping Mission, which documents and digitally presents local traditions, 
art forms and practices of rural India.237 The initiative encourages local communities to share stories, 
photographs and cultural data, contributing to a repository of region-specific cultural knowledge. 
However, this participation is content-based and does not extend to AI development or governance 
processes.

CHAPTER 4
Scientific and educational dimension
The scientific and educational dimension of the RAM explores India’s capacity to generate AI knowledge, 
support research and innovation, and build a skilled AI workforce. It reviews public investment in 
research and development (R&D), the quality and volume of research output, AI education, and the 
extent of interdisciplinary collaboration. India’s gross expenditure on R&D (GERD) stood at INR 1.27 
lakh crore (approximately USD 14.23 billion) in 2020/21,238 while over 86,000 AI patents have been 
filed between 2010 and 2025 (accounting for over 25 per cent of all tech patents filed in the country 
during this period),239 indicating growing innovation activity in the sector. This chapter also examines 
national strategies to integrate AI into higher education, expand infrastructure for AI training, and 
align curriculum content with evolving technological needs. These efforts are complemented by 
digital platforms, online courses and targeted initiatives that aim to increase AI literacy and access.
Research and innovation in AI
Schemes, investments and publications
Scientific research in India is supported by a range of institutions, with the Department of Science & 
Technology (DST) serving as the primary government body for promoting science, technology and 
innovation, including in the field of AI. In the 2025/26 Union Budget, funding for the DST’s central 
government schemes saw a significant increase, from approximately INR 2,300 crore (approximately 
USD 257.7 million) in 2024/25 to INR 20,000 crore (approximately USD 2.33 billion) in 2025/26.240 This 
substantial boost reflects the government’s growing emphasis on strategic technologies, including AI.
One of the DST’s main initiatives is the Vigyan Dhara scheme, which focuses on institutional and human 
capacity building, research and development, and the deployment of innovative technologies.241 
Its budget allocation rose from INR 330.75 crore (approximately USD 37.05 million) in 2024/25 to 
INR 1,425 crore (approximately USD 159.6 million) in 2025/26, a 4.3-fold increase242 that indicates 
strong support for foundational science and innovation systems.
In addition to core funding programmes, the DST also supports AI research through specialized 
schemes and international collaborations. The ASEAN-India Collaborative R&D programme (2024) 
includes a focus on AI and high-performance computing, with 43 out of 288 proposals recommended 
for financial support.243 Under the US-India Science and Technology Endowment Fund, a new USD 
2 million joint grant programme was launched in 2023 to support innovations in AI and quantum 
technologies, with seventeen projects shortlisted.244 Domestically, the National Mission on 
Interdisciplinary Cyber-Physical Systems, an INR 3,660 crore initiative (approximately USD 410 million), 
has established twenty-five technology innovation hubs across premier Indian institutions, many of 
which focus on AI-related fields such as machine learning, data analytics and speech processing.245 
These hubs support both fundamental research and real-world applications, such as AI-driven assistive 
tools for the visually impaired246 and intelligent monitoring systems for vehicle emissions.247
Parallelly, the government has signalled policy intent to integrate AI into India’s scientific research 
ecosystem. In a 2025 review of the DST, the Minister for Science and Technology called for bold 
investments in AI-led innovations and support for deep tech start-ups, including plans for an indigenous 
‘India AI Open Stack’, tailored to the needs of researchers.248 The Anusandhan National Research 
Foundation under the DST is also preparing to launch an ‘AI-for-science’ initiative, aiming to accelerate 
scientific discovery by applying AI to complex research problems in physics, chemistry and biology.249

India’s GERD stood at INR 1,27,380.96 crore (approximately USD 14.27 billion) in the fiscal year 
2020/21,250 accounting for around 0.65 per cent of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP).251 
Of this, government investment amounted to INR 80,992.83 crore (approximately USD 9.07 billion), 
with the remainder contributed by the private sector.252 While specific GERD data for natural sciences 
and engineering is unavailable, available data indicates R&D expenditure across leading sectors, 
highlighting the share of public and private investment within each.253
To further advance AI research and innovation, the government has launched the IndiaAI Mission, 
which allocates INR 1,971.37 crore (approximately USD 220.8 million) to its Innovation Centre and 
INR 689.05 crore (approximately USD 77.2 million) to its AI Application Development Initiative 
(AIADI).254 While the Innovation Centre focuses on developing indigenous foundational AI models, 
the AIADI supports the creation of AI solutions for critical sectors.255
In 2024, India had 8.3 AI or AI-related publications and 7.5 AI citations, per million people.256 In 2024, 
researchers from India had 42 responsible AI papers accepted at select leading AI conferences.257 India 
has 11 Kaggle Grandmasters.258 Additionally, India contributed approximately 11.7 per cent of total 
commits to public AI projects on GitHub in 2023.259 Between 2010 and 2025, 86,000 AI patents were 
filed in India, accounting for over 25 per cent of all technology patents filed in India. However, India’s 
share of AI patents granted is only 0.37 per cent.260

AI in education
Policies, infrastructure and curricula for school education
In 2020, India’s Ministry of Education released the National Education Policy (NEP), which is the basis 
for reforming primary, secondary and higher education in India. The NEP is built on five foundational 
pillars: access, equity, quality, affordability and accountability. It recommends integrating AI into 
all levels of education261 and encourages higher education institutions (HEIs) to lead both core and 
applied AI research. The policy also proposed the creation of a national research foundation under the 
DST, the Anusandhan National Research Foundation, to support research activities, including in AI.262
The NEP acknowledges the disruptive potential of AI and the potential harm caused by automation 
taking over unskilled jobs. It also notes that the demand for a skilled workforce that has core 
computational abilities in computer science and mathematics will be on the rise and that the education 
system needs to weave AI into its curricula.263
Infrastructure readiness in schools varies by level. In India, as of 2024, 43.5 per cent of primary day 
schools, 54.4 per cent of lower secondary schools, and 64.3 per cent of secondary schools had 
internet access for pedagogical purposes. Further, 89.6 per cent of upper secondary schools, 59 per 
cent of lower secondary schools, and 42.7 per cent of primary schools had access to computers for 
pedagogical purposes.264 Overall, according to the Ministry of Education, 53.9 per cent of schools have 
access to the internet and 57.2 per cent have computer facilities.265
An instance of ongoing efforts to equip schools with the necessary technological resources for 
modern education is the National Digital Education Architecture (NDEAR), launched by the Ministry of

Education. NDEAR is an initiative to create a unifying national digital infrastructure for education, and 
serves as a framework comprising principles, standards, specifications, building blocks and guidelines. 
These enable various stakeholders, including government bodies, educational institutions and 
private entities, to develop interoperable digital solutions, such as student registries, teacher training 
platforms, learning content repositories, and assessment tools.266 NDEAR is designed to support not 
just teaching and learning, but also education planning, administration and governance across the 
centre and states/union territories by enabling modular digital infrastructure (such as registries, 
analytics platforms and interoperable data systems) that can be used to streamline service delivery 
and inform policy decisions.267
The Digital Infrastructure for Knowledge Sharing (DIKSHA) portal is a real-world, working example that 
demonstrates how the NDEAR framework (its principles, standards and architecture) can be applied to 
build digital education infrastructure. DIKSHA is a free-to-use national platform for school education 
and offers over 1.5 billion learning sessions in 32 languages.268 In 2023, it also announced plans to 
integrate AI-powered personalized adaptive learning for students.269
The NEP also acknowledges the importance of raising awareness about the ethical challenges of 
emerging disruptive technologies like AI through continued education.270 It recognized the need to 
meet the new demand of a skilled workforce that can tackle technological advances like big data, 
machine learning and AI.271 Additionally, the National Skill Development Corporation272 seeks to 
introduce digital and entrepreneurship-oriented training from kindergarten to Grade 12 to bridge 
academic learning with practical, industry-relevant skills.273
Beyond the NEP, the FutureSkills pillar of the India AI Mission currently focuses on three core 
initiatives:274 1. national fellowship programmes for undergraduate to doctoral students to build 
advanced AI research capability; 2. the establishment of AI and Data Labs in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities 
to provide hands-on learning and access to tools and datasets; and 3. the development of industry-
aligned certification courses to prepare learners for entry-level AI roles and promote responsible and 
ethical AI use. Future offerings will include modular and domain-specific learning pathways across 
sectors such as agriculture, healthcare, manufacturing and education. 
The government seeks to encourage scientific curiosity in students at the school level through 
initiatives like the Atal Innovation Mission (AIM). The AIM, launched in 2016 under NITI Aayog, 
supports innovation and entrepreneurship in schools and colleges.275 In the first phase of the AIM, 
over 9,000 Atal Tinkering Labs (ATLs) were set up in rural and urban schools across 722 districts to 
provide hands-on experience in emerging technologies, encourage problem solving and promote 
a scientific temper among students.276 In March 2024, the AIM and NITI Aayog, with private sector 
partners, launched Frontier Technology Labs in schools to further AI education alongside AR/VR, 
blockchain, cybersecurity, robotics and the Internet of Things (IoT).277 Further, in its 2025/26 budget, 
the government announced the establishment of 50,000 ATLs across government schools in the next 
five years.278 In 2025, the scheme received a budgetary outlay of INR 400 crore (approximately USD 
44.8 million), which is a significant increase from INR 109.35 crore (approximately USD 12.25 million) 
in the previous year.279
The National e-Governance Division under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology 
(IT Ministry) has launched YUVAi: Youth for Unnati and Vikas with AI, a programme to build AI awareness 
and skills among school students from Grades 8 to 12. The initiative aims to equip students with both

technical and social competencies through an inclusive approach. It encourages them to explore AI-
driven solutions across sectors such as agriculture, health, education, environment, transportation, 
rural development, urban planning and justice.280
The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), in collaboration with industry partners, has 
integrated AI into the syllabus for Grades 8 to 10, covering topics like neural networks, NLP, data 
science and AI ethics, aiming to train over 100,000 students.281 The International General Certificate 
of Secondary Education (ICSE), in partnership with the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi, has 
also introduced AI, ML and data science for Grades 9 to 12. Several state education boards, too, have 
incorporated AI into their curricula.282
AI and higher education
In 2021/22, there were 10,000–15,000 STEM graduates with AI/ML and data sciences courses in their 
curriculum in India.283 The NEP encourages higher education institutions to lead core and applied AI 
research, offer multidisciplinary programmes (AI+X) that integrate AI with domains like healthcare, 
agriculture and law, and develop skilling courses for emerging job roles across sectors.284 Further, the 
IITs and institutes accredited by the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) offer AI-related 
courses, including AI/ML fundamentals, deep learning, NLP, and computer vision, at the university 
level.285 The AICTE has also developed a model AI/ML curriculum for undergraduate programmes, 
which includes components on the ethical use of AI. For instance, a course called Solve Business 
Problems with AI features a dedicated module on ethics.286 The Visvesvaraya PhD Scheme was 
launched to increase the number of Ph.D.s in electronics system design and manufacturing (ESDM) 
and information technology/IT-enabled services (IT/ITES). The scheme includes research areas such as 
AI (covering eighty-two Ph.D. fellows) and ML (covering fifty-nine Ph.D. fellows).287
A growing number of institutions in India offer AI-focused academic programmes and research 
opportunities, many of which also cover ethical considerations in AI as a part of their curricula.288 
These include dedicated centres such as the Robert Bosch Centre for Data Science and AI in Chennai, 
the Centre for Responsible AI at IIT Madras, the AI CoE at IIT Kharagpur,289 and the Indian Institute of 
Science (IISc) AI Group.290 Others, like the National Institute of Robotics & Artificial Intelligence, offer a 
range of AI-related courses, including specialized postgraduate programmes in AI and ML. Additionally, 
government-backed initiatives, such as the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO’s) 
Young Scientist Laboratory, focus on advancing AI research in strategic and emerging areas.291 As of 
2023, India had 27.09 per cent science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) graduates 
and 3.9 per cent information and communication technology (ICT) graduates from tertiary education 
programmes.292
Although there is no disaggregated data on the number of AI-related Ph.D. and postdoctoral students 
in India, as of 2022, based on government data, enrolment in engineering and technology at the 
Ph.D. level is highest, at 24.8 per cent, followed by science at 21.3 per cent.293 Additionally, 62 per 
cent of 69 surveyed Indian HEIs offer programmes in AI, data science or related areas. Of these, 80 per 
cent offer undergraduate programmes, 57 per cent offer graduate programmes, and 58 per cent offer 
Ph.D. programmes in these fields.294 As of 2018, India ranked 13th globally in terms of the number 
of influential presenters at leading AI conferences, with 44 researchers featured.295 Data from the 
Coursera Global Skills Report 2024 indicates that India ranks 87th globally in data science skills, while 
its standing in the Asia Pacific region is 17th overall.296

AI Centres of Excellence in India
India has also witnessed a significant rise in the number of Centres of Excellence dedicated 
to AI, spanning both public and private sectors. These CoEs function as key institutions for 
advancing AI research and developing sector-specific solutions. In 2025/26, the government 
allocated INR 500 crore (approximately USD 56 million) to establish a new CoE focused 
on AI in education.i This follows a broader government initiative announced in 2024 to 
create three national-level AI CoEs in other domains, namely healthcare, agriculture and 
sustainable cities.ii These national centres are led by top academic institutions and operate 
in close partnership with start-ups and industry partners. Their scope typically includes 
building institutional capacity, undertaking applied R&D and facilitating AI adoption in 
priority sectors. Besides government-led initiatives, academic institutionsiii and private 
actorsiv have also established independent or collaborative CoEs.

Technical and ethical AI courses for the general public
The government has introduced initiatives to enhance AI education for the general public. AI for All is 
a self-learning programme, launched by the Ministry of Education, aimed at increasing AI awareness 
and elaborating on principles of responsible AI and ethics of AI.297 Similarly, the Ministry of Skill 
Development and Entrepreneurship collaborated with industry players to introduce AI for India, 
a free course available in multiple regional languages, ensuring broader accessibility.298
AI ethics education is also gradually gaining importance. Private companies have been offering 
specialized courses on responsible AI use, addressing issues like bias, fairness and transparency.299 
Online platforms also provide AI ethics modules, though most are currently in English.300

CHAPTER 5
Economic dimension
The economic dimension of the RAM evaluates how AI is integrated into India’s development 
priorities and its potential as a driver of inclusive growth. This chapter examines national policies that 
promote AI adoption in key sectors, incentives for start-ups and micro, small and medium enterprises 
(MSMEs), private sector investments, and job market transitions arising from AI deployment. India’s AI 
ecosystem is projected to contribute USD 28.8 billion to the national gross domestic product (GDP) 
by 2025,301 reflecting its growing role in shaping productivity and innovation. This economic impact is 
evident in rising investments in talent, infrastructure and sector-specific applications by both public 
and private actors. India’s start-up ecosystem, supported by substantial funding, continues to develop 
AI-driven solutions tailored to diverse domestic and global challenges. This dimension also explores 
AI-related labour market considerations such as skill penetration in India, as well as skilling efforts by 
the government and the private sector, to prepare the workforce for an AI-enabled economy.
Labour markets and talent concentration
The Indian government has underscored its focus on skilling to prepare India’s workforce for emerging 
technologies, including in AI, by setting a target of equipping at least 1 million people with AI tools and 
skills.302 The government is working to align higher education curricula with evolving technological 
needs. University syllabi are being revised to include AI, 5G and semiconductor design, with the aim of 
making graduates more job-ready and reducing transition time between education and employment. 
India’s progress in developing an AI-ready workforce is reflected in a range of skill penetration metrics 
and industry forecasts:
•  India’s AI-skilled workforce has grown 14-fold from 2016 to 2023, placing the country among the top 
five fastest-growing AI talent hubs globally.303 The demand for AI professionals is projected to reach 
1 million by 2026.304
•  India ranked second globally in AI skill penetration with a score of 2.51, second to the USA which 
has a score of 2.63.305 Further, AI talent concentration in India has grown by 252 per cent since 2016. 
AI talent concentration for men is 0.89 per cent and for women 0.92 per cent.306 As of 2024, India is 
estimated to house around 16 per cent of the world’s AI talent.307
•  Although there is no disaggregated data on the share of current employees working as data 
scientists, studies suggest that there is critical demand for data scientists, ML engineers, data 
engineers, data architects and DevOps engineers, together making up approximately 73 per cent of 
all AI job opening in India.308

•  The National Programme on AI-Skilling Framework (NPAI-SF), developed by the Skill Development 
Ministry, serves primarily as an evaluation framework and offers non-binding strategic guidance for 
AI skilling. It outlines a three-tiered approach targeting: i. basic end users; ii. productivity-focused 
users; and iii. aspiring AI professionals.318 It also suggests sector-specific reskilling in areas such as 
healthcare and agriculture, proposes the creation of more Centres of Excellence (CoEs) to improve 
AI accessibility, and encourages industry-academia collaboration and public-private partnerships 
for practical training.319
•  The IndiaAI FutureSkills pillar aims to reduce barriers to entry into AI programmes by increasing 
AI courses at undergraduate, postgraduate and doctoral levels. It also proposes the establishment 
of data and AI labs in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities to offer foundational courses,320 with an allocation of 
INR 882.9 crore (approximately USD 99 million).321
•  The IT Ministry conducts joint cybersecurity training programmes with the Indian Computer 
Emergency Response Team (CERT-In), including programmes focused on AI-powered cybersecurity 
threats. CERT-In also supported the Gen AI Exchange Hackathon for developers, professionals and 
entrepreneurs in 2024.322 Separately, the IT Ministry’s FutureSkills Prime initiative offers 119 AI-
specific courses as part of a broader upskilling programme on emerging technologies. Over 1.86 
million candidates have registered on the FutureSkills PRIME portal, of whom over 337,000 have 
completed their courses.323 The FutureSkills PRIME platform also offers courses on AI ethics, which 
cover key concepts such as ethical principles of AI, its importance and social implications, and why 
responsible AI development matters.324
State governments have also played an active role in supporting AI skilling efforts. Public-private 
partnerships at the state level have enabled the creation of advanced training centres focused on 
emerging tech fields such as AI, robotics, Industry 4.0 and immersive technologies.325 The Skill 
Development Ministry, in collaboration with the private sector and ten state governments, has 
also committed to training 2 million people in India on AI by 2025 through its ADVANTA(I)GE INDIA 
initiative.326 The programme offers AI training for 500,000 students and job seekers at 100 rural 
vocational centres, and provides targeted training for 100,000 young women in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities 
through 5,000 trainers.327
Parliamentarians have raised concerns about AI’s potential impact on employment and questioned 
whether the government has assessed the risk of job displacement. In response, the government 
noted that the issue is under active consideration, and the Ministry of Labour and Employment 
emphasized that AI may also create new opportunities in areas such as data science and curation.328
Private sector efforts in AI skilling
Private sector efforts are contributing significantly to AI skilling across India. As per reports, Indian 
companies are now investing up to 1.5 per cent of their revenues into workforce learning and 
development, with a growing focus on AI upskilling, to stay competitive.329 Many leading information 
technology (IT) and financial services companies in India are investing in AI upskilling programmes 
for their employees. These initiatives include large-scale training efforts across engineering and non-
engineering roles, internal skilling platforms in partnership with academic institutions, and specialized 
education programmes to build AI capabilities across departments such as operations, treasury and 
sales.330

Investments and outputs
As per the Global Innovation Index 2025, India ranks 38th of 139 economies. It performs better 
on innovation outputs, where it ranks 33rd, than on innovation inputs, where it stands at 44th.331 
Innovation outputs reflect the results of innovation activities, such as scientific publications, patents 
and technology creation, while innovation inputs reflect the resources and conditions that enable 
innovation. In 2025, high-tech exports accounted for 5.1 per cent of India’s total trade.332 Earlier, in 
2022, India’s high-tech exports were valued at USD 35.24 billion, a 22.49 per cent increase from 2021.333 
Specifically on generative AI, surveys show that 36 per cent of Indian enterprises have allocated 
budgets and started investing in generative AI, while another 24 per cent are testing its potential.334
Empowering women in AI careers
Launched by the Skill Development Ministry, the AI Careers for Women programme 
is helping bridge the gender gap in India’s AI workforce by establishing 3 Centres of 
Excellence in women’s colleges across 6 states, with support for 150 secondary partner 
institutions in Tier 2 and Tier 3 towns.i The programme offers a 240-hour curriculum

AI start-ups in India
India’s AI start-up ecosystem is being actively shaped by strong government backing. Through 
flagship programmes like the Startup India initiative (launched in 2016), the government has sought 
to build a supportive environment for innovation and entrepreneurship.335 AI start-ups recognized 
under Startup India benefit from tax exemptions, fast-tracked patent processes, and access to 
government procurement channels. Startup India offers tax benefits, simplified registration processes, 
self-certification for labour and environmental laws, relaxed norms for public procurement, and 
infrastructure support via innovation centres and technology parks.336
The Small Industries Development Bank of India manages the fund of funds (FoF) for start-ups,337 
launched in 2016 with a corpus of INR 10,000 crore (approximately USD 1.1 billion).338 This fund 
provides indirect equity support to all start-ups through alternative investment funds (AIFs). This 
amount has been fully allocated, ahead of its March 2026 target, to 138 registered AIFs.339
Beyond overall start-up support, the government has launched targeted initiatives to accelerate AI 
innovation. A key initiative is the IndiaAI Mission, which has allocated INR 10,371.92 crore (approximately 
USD 1.2 billion) over five years (2024/29) for the development of India’s AI ecosystem.340 Under the 
Mission, the AI Application Development Initiative (AIADI) seeks to support scalable AI solutions with 
socio-economic impact.341 Over 900 proposals were submitted to the IndiaAI Innovation Challenge, 
addressing different sectors, of which 30 AI solutions have been shortlisted for the next stage.342 
Additionally, the Startup Financing pillar under IndiaAI is fostering AI entrepreneurship by providing 
funding, incubation and mentorship to early-stage ventures, and has been allocated INR 1,942.5 crore 
(approximately USD 217 million).343 As of 2024, there were over 2,900 AI-focused start-ups in India, 
recognized by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), Government of 
India.344 Indian AI start-ups attracted substantial interest, raising USD 1.2 billion in funding in 2024 
alone.345
The country’s generative AI start-up ecosystem has also shown remarkable expansion, growing at an 
annual rate of 3.6 times in 2024.346 Reports indicate that Indian generative AI start-up funding surged 
over six times quarter-on-quarter, reaching USD 51 million in the second quarter of the financial year 
2024/25, driven by B2B and agentic AI start-ups.347
While the number of pure-play AI start-ups (those building core AI foundational models) remains 
relatively limited, the broader ecosystem is expanding rapidly.348 Constraints around compute 
infrastructure and funding have steered the ecosystem toward practical, use-case-driven start-ups 
that address real-world challenges in areas like agriculture, healthcare and climate, reflecting a broader 
focus on developing AI solutions tailored to India’s specific needs.
The government has also taken steps to support deep tech innovation through targeted funding 
mechanisms and policy frameworks. The draft National Deep Tech Startup Policy was released to 
foster innovation, economic growth and societal development.349 The policy offers a comprehensive 
framework to address challenges faced by deep tech start-ups, focusing on areas such as research and 
development, funding, infrastructure, intellectual property and capacity building. The government 
has also announced a dedicated FoF for deep tech start-ups,350 with a corpus of INR 10,000 crore 
(approximately USD 1.12 billion).351 This initiative aims to bridge critical financing gaps faced by deep 
tech ventures in AI, semiconductors, quantum technologies and other frontier sectors.

Private investment
Private investments have played a key role in the growth of AI in India. Between 2013 and 2024, India 
secured USD 11.29 billion in cumulative private AI investments.352 Private investments in AI in India 
stood at USD 1.16 billion in 2024,353 while the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development 
(UNCTAD) estimated the figure at USD 1.4 billion in 2023, ranking India 10th out of 170 countries in 
terms of private investment in AI.354
At the same time, venture capital (VC) and growth funding in software and software as a service (SaaS), 
including generative AI, rose approximately 1.2 times to USD 1.7 billion between 2023 and 2024, as 
more scaled Indian AI firms attracted international interest.355 Generative AI funding grew about 
1.5 times during this period, with most of this investment focused on applications and platforms 
rather than capital-intensive foundational models. Within this, generative AI funding grew from USD 
250 million to USD 390 million between 2023 and 2024.356
India’s AI start-up ecosystem also witnessed a 39.9 per cent increase in overall funding in 2024, 
reaching USD 780.5 million, driven largely by a rise in late-stage investments.357 India has over 520 
tech incubators and accelerators, ranking third globally in active programmes. Nearly 42 per cent of 
these were launched in the past five years. AI-focused accelerators provide mentorship in product 
development, business strategy and scaling.358 Late-stage funding accounted for USD 554 million, 
reflecting a shift in investor preference towards scalable, high-impact enterprises. However, early- 
stage funding declined by 37 per cent, highlighting a capital gap for newer entrants.359 This shift is 
reflective of a broader trend: investors are prioritizing start-ups with proven market traction over 
seed-stage bets, posing challenges for early-stage AI entrepreneurs.
In 2022, India received 122 AI-related foreign direct investment (FDI) projects, with major multinational 
companies making key contributions to this figure.360 Global technology firms are increasingly 
investing in India’s AI ecosystem through a mix of FDI, R&D initiatives and strategic partnerships. These 
investments span the development of AI infrastructure, establishment of local R&D centres, and the 
funding of India-linked start-ups focused on AI-first solutions. For instance, one global AI firm has 
committed USD 250 million over three years for R&D, talent development and enterprise adoption 
in India,361 and a global VC fund also plans to invest USD 100 million in India- linked AI and deep tech 
start-ups.362
Multinational corporations are also collaborating with Indian industry to build supercomputing 
infrastructure and develop large language models (LLMs) tailored for India, with some partnerships 
involving cloud platforms and AI chipsets to support wide-scale adoption.363 International companies 
are also increasingly engaging India as a key market for AI products, with some planning to have local 
teams or data centres to support Indian users, as the country has one of the top user bases for leading 
global AI applications.364
Intermediate consumption
India does not currently publish disaggregated national statistics on enterprise-level spending on 
AI services specifically. However, data from the National Accounts Statistics, 2025365 offer insight into 
the broader category of ‘information and computer related services’. In the financial year 2022/23, 
total output in this category was about INR 13.21 lakh crore (approximately USD 148.1 billion), with 
intermediate consumption at INR 3.57 lakh crore (approximately USD 39.9 billion), representing about 
27 per cent of output. Private estimates suggest that India will spend around USD 6 billion on AI-
centric systems by 2027. This includes software, services and hardware, with a projected compounded 
annual growth rate (CAGR) of 33 per cent between 2022 and 2027.366

Indian enterprises rely on a combination of imported and domestic AI services. Foundational 
capabilities such as model training and data processing are often accessed via global cloud platforms, 
with increasing Indian suppliers entering the market. At the same time, India’s domestic ecosystem, 
comprising start-ups and IT firms, is increasingly delivering AI consulting, application development 
and sector-specific solutions. While imported infrastructure continues to play a key role in enterprise 
AI adoption, India is steadily building local capacity, particularly in the application and integration 
layers of the AI value chain.

CHAPTER 6
Technical and infrastructural dimension
The technical and infrastructural dimension of the RAM assesses India’s capacity to support secure, 
scalable and inclusive AI development. It examines national connectivity, compute infrastructure, 
data centre capacity, technical standards and statistical systems. Building robust and accessible AI 
infrastructure is a key priority for the Government of India.367 Its efforts are concentrated on three pillars: 
establishing modern data centres, expanding AI computing infrastructure, and advancing semiconductor 
manufacturing.368 The IndiaAI Mission anchors these efforts, including the rollout of a national compute 
platform with over 34,000 graphics processing units (GPUs)369 and subsidized access for researchers 
and start-ups.370 Complementary initiatives focus on domestic chip design, state-level cloud policies 
and high-performance systems like the AI Research Analytics and Knowledge Dissemination Platform 
(AIRAWAT).371 This chapter examines connectivity initiatives, cloud and national compute programmes, 
and the evolution of AI-related technical standards and statistical capacity in India.
Infrastructure and connectivity
As of April 2024, India reported approximately 1,199.28 million telephone subscribers, including 1,165.49 
million wireless subscribers, resulting in a tele-density of 85.69 percent, with urban tele- density at 133.72 
per cent and rural at 59.10 per cent.372 In comparison, the global average mobile cellular subscription 
rate was 112 per 100 inhabitants in 2024.373 India’s broadband subscriber base stood at 943.09 million, 
comprising 901.67 million wireless and 41.41 million wireline subscribers.374 According to International 
Telecommunication Union (ITU) data, India had 60.2 active mobile broadband subscriptions per 100 
inhabitants in 2023, compared to the global average of 94.6 per 100 inhabitants in 2024.375 There 
were 39.5 million fixed broadband subscriptions in India in 2023,376 and the average fixed broadband 
download speed was 61.55 Mbps.377 International bandwidth usage in India was 112 million Mbit/s.378 
Mobile network coverage in India was extensive, with 98.9 per cent of the population covered by at least 
a 3G network in 2023,379 compared to the global average of 95.6 per cent.380 Internet usage in India was 
at 55.9 per cent of the population in 2022,381 below the global average of 68 per cent.382

The Government of India launched the BharatNet initiative in 2011, aiming to provide high-speed 
broadband connectivity to all Gram Panchayats. As of April 2025, 95.15 per cent of villages had 
achieved 3G/4G connectivity.383 Further, as of 2023, 99.5 per cent of the population receives near- 
universal electricity.384 State governments have also implemented programmes to enhance digital 
infrastructure and public service delivery.385
Applied standards
India’s national standard setting body, the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) is a part of the ISO/IEC 
JTC 1/SC 42 Committee that formulates standards for developing AI applications.386 In April 2025, 
the BIS hosted the 15th plenary meeting of SC 42 in New Delhi, attended by over 350 experts from 
70 countries.387 Domestically, the BIS has constituted the AI Sectional Committee (LITD 30), which 
includes multistakeholder representation from academia, industry, research institutions and central 
government bodies. This committee, along with its working groups, is engaged in reviewing and 
adapting various ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42 standards on AI for applicability within the Indian context.388 
Further, the Telecommunication Engineering Centre (TEC), India’s telecom standard-setting body 
under the Department of Telecommunications, is developing sector-specific standards for the 
application of AI in telecommunications. In July 2023, the TEC published the Standard for Fairness 
Assessment and Rating of Artificial Intelligence Systems389 and, in June 2025, released a draft standard 
for assessing and rating the robustness of AI systems in telecom networks and digital infrastructure, 
for public comment.390 The latter is yet to be adopted.

Compute capabilities
India is expanding its AI compute infrastructure through the Compute Capacity pillar of the IndiaAI 
Mission. The government aims to build a high-performance, scalable ecosystem to support AI research, 
innovation and start-ups.391 The initiative is centred on the creation of a national AI compute platform 
comprising over 34,000 GPUs, developed through public-private partnerships.392 To operationalize 
access, a dedicated AI compute portal has been launched, providing researchers and start-ups with 
subsidized access to the acquired GPUs. Under this model, the government provides a 40 per cent 
subsidy, bringing GPU usage costs down to less than USD 1 per hour, compared to global averages of 
USD 2.5 to 3 per hour.393
In August 2024, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (IT Ministry) issued a request 
for empanelment of agencies to provide AI services on cloud, with ten service providers selected in 
the first round and seven more shortlisted in the second.394 These providers collectively offer GPU 
resources exceeding initial targets. In addition, the Government of India has invited proposals from 
start-ups, entrepreneurs and academic institutions to build foundational AI models trained on Indian 
datasets, offering compute credits and equity-based funding for selected projects. The initiative is 
aligned with efforts to develop LLMs built on Indian datasets. At present, four start-ups have been 
shortlisted to develop these models,395 alongside the government-funded BharatGen, a multi-modal 
foundational model initiative focused on speech, vision and language applications in public service 
delivery.396
India’s high-performance computing infrastructure is also supported by AIRAWAT, a national AI 
supercomputing platform offering 200 petaflops of compute power and ranked 75th globally as of 
2023. AIRAWAT is integrated with the National Knowledge Network, enabling connectivity among 
academic institutions, public research bodies and innovation hubs.397
India is investing in indigenous semiconductor capabilities to support AI and advanced computing. 
At the national level, the India Semiconductor Mission (ISM) serves as the central programme for 
building a robust semiconductor ecosystem, aiming to position India as a global hub for electronics 
manufacturing and design.398 The ISM is backed by an outlay of INR 75,000 crore (approximately 
USD 8.51 billion), of which nearly INR 65,000 crore (approximately USD 7.6 billion) has already been 
committed.399 Complementing ISM are two major incentive schemes: the Production Linked Incentive 
scheme, which provides financial incentives for domestic manufacturing across fourteen strategic 
sectors,400 and the Design Linked Incentive scheme, which supports semiconductor design, research 
and development (R&D) and commercialization through targeted fiscal support and access to design 
infrastructure.401 Under the latter, twenty-three chip design projects have been sanctioned, as of 
writing this report.402 These national programmes are further supported by initiatives by the Centre 
for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC).403
India’s national and state-level cloud computing policies are closely tied to its digital public 
infrastructure strategy. The enhancement of the National Informatics Centre (NIC’s) National Cloud 
Services, launched in 2022, aims to modernize the government’s central cloud infrastructure for 
enhanced e-governance. As of early 2025, over 300 government departments use these services to 
support digital applications. The GI Cloud (MeghRaj) initiative provides shared cloud infrastructure 
across departments and promotes IT optimization for applications such as digital payments, digital 
identity and consent-based data sharing.404
Several states have also adopted cloud policies.405 These efforts contribute to localized digital 
transformation while aligning with the national Digital India programme.

India has a growing data centre ecosystem, which underpins cloud infrastructure and AI deployment. 
As of July 2024, India had 259 data centres, including public and private facilities, with major hubs in 
Mumbai (37 centres) and Bengaluru (21 centres).406 Public infrastructure includes the NIC’s National 
Data Centres (NDCs) in Delhi, Pune, Bhubaneswar and Hyderabad. These NDCs provide cloud services, 
disaster recovery and secure hosting for the central and state governments. Additional infrastructure 
includes the NDC Northeast Region, launched in 2020, and a new Tier 3 NDC in Guwahati, under 
development to support regional connectivity and digital services in the north-east.407
Despite this growth, India currently ranks 58th of 74 countries in colocation data centres per million 
population, with a score of 3.1 out of 10.408 The government is supporting expanded infrastructure 
through policy incentives and regulatory streamlining. India currently has around 1.4 GW of active 
data-centre capacity, with recent reports estimating an additional 1.4 GW being built, with roughly 
5 GW more in the pipeline.409
Currently, India does not have a stand-alone policy dedicated to AI-driven cloud computing. However, 
cloud services will be broadly regulated under the Data Protection Act, the IT Act and its associated 
rules, and through sector-specific regulations such as the RBI’s directions on outsourcing IT services 
(2023).410
Statistical performance
India’s Statistical Performance Indicators (SPI) score of 73.6 out of 100 places it in the third quintile 
globally.411 These scores evaluate statistical capacity across five key areas: data use, data services, data 
products, data sources and data infrastructure.412

CHAPTER 7
Developing a national multistakeholder roadmap
Mapping the ecosystem
India’s AI ecosystem is shaped by a broad and diverse set of stakeholders, including the government, 
parliament, large technology firms, start-ups, academic and research institutions, civil society 
organizations and the judiciary. Each actor contributes to advancing AI innovation, promoting ethical 
deployment and expanding access to AI capabilities across sectors.
All three branches of the Union Government – the legislature, the executive and the judiciary – play 
distinct but complementary roles in shaping the AI ecosystem. The legislature (the Indian Parliament) 
exercises oversight through debates, questions and committee hearings/reports, particularly via the 
Standing Committee on Communications and IT. The executive, led by the Prime Minister’s Office and 
supported by ministries such as the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (IT Ministry), 
the Office of the Principal Scientific Adviser, and NITI Aayog, drives AI policy formulation, strategy and 
implementation through flagship initiatives like the IndiaAI Mission. Sectoral ministries are responsible 
for domain-specific adoption, infrastructure and innovation promotion. Regulatory and standard-
setting responsibilities are shared between sectoral regulators (e.g. in health, finance, telecom), and 
cross-sectoral bodies address issues like competition, consumer protection and technology standards. 
A growing volume of AI-related litigation is becoming a focal point in India. Issues around deepfakes, 
copyright infringement and algorithmic bias are increasingly finding their way into courts, making 
the judiciary a critical player in the evolution of ethical AI governance. The Indian judiciary is itself 
embracing AI technology, with the Supreme Court’s eCommittee working to implement AI tools to 
enhance judicial efficiency.
State governments are also playing a critical role in advancing India’s AI ecosystem. Many are 
formulating dedicated AI policies, establishing innovation clusters, launching pilot projects and 
offering investment incentives to strengthen domestic AI infrastructure and attract talent. Notably, AI 
adoption is no longer confined to traditional technology hubs. While cities like Bengaluru, Hyderabad, 
Chennai and Delhi remain key centres, emerging urban areas across the country are becoming 
increasingly active. This geographic diversification is driven by regional research ecosystems, localized 
innovation strategies, and a growing focus on using AI to address sectoral challenges in healthcare, 
education, agriculture and public service delivery.
The private sector, including both domestic technology firms and foreign multinational companies, 
are fundamental in expanding India’s AI capabilities. Large Indian firms like TCS, Infosys, HCL, 
Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel are strengthening AI infrastructure through investments, large-scale 
skilling initiatives or start-up incubation.413 Companies like Yotta, E2E Networks, NxtGen and Orient 
Technologies have been empanelled to provide GPU-based compute infrastructure at prices lower 
than most global markets, explicitly aimed at enabling India’s AI ecosystem.414 Alongside these 
contributions, there is growing emphasis on ethics and safety. TCS and Infosys have adopted internal 
frameworks emphasizing fairness, explainability and human oversight; Wipro has launched a 
Responsible AI Lab focused on bias mitigation and algorithmic transparency. Foreign multinational 
companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and NVIDIA have also established, or partnered with, 
Indian AI research centres.415

### Page 67

54
The Indian AI start-up ecosystem has experienced significant growth, particularly in terms of funding, 
with AI start-ups raising USD 747 million in venture capital funding in 2024.416 Key AI unicorns like 
Krutrim, Fractal Analytics, Soket Labs and Corover.ai are at the forefront of developing AI-driven 
solutions across industries such as analytics, conversational AI and enterprise software. Additionally, 
start-ups working alongside the IndiaAI Mission are developing homegrown solutions for healthcare, 
governance and other domains. The government’s emphasis on indigenous AI model development 
has also sparked increased private interest in foundational AI technologies.
India’s academic and research institutions play a pivotal role in advancing AI, with premier institutes 
like the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), the Indian Institutes of Information Technology (IIITs), the 
Indian Statistical Institute and the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) driving 
innovation. Specialized AI research centres, including the Robert Bosch Centre for Data Science and 
Artificial Intelligence at IIT Madras, the Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics under the Defence 
Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), the Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence in 
Mumbai, and the International Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at IIT Jodhpur, are at 
the forefront of AI research. Civil society organizations and policy think tanks are also contributing to 
India’s responsible AI ecosystem by foregrounding issues of ethics, accountability and digital rights. 
Groups such as, though not limited to, the Centre for Internet and Society, Digital Future Lab, IT for 
Change, and Aapti Institute, are shaping AI governance discourse through research, advocacy and 
engagement with policy-makers. Their work helps bridge technical innovation with public interest 
concerns, particularly around algorithmic bias, inclusion and data governance.
Methodology of the Readiness Assessment
Overview of stakeholder engagement on India’s AI readiness
In July 2024, UNESCO partnered with the IndiaAI Mission (established under the IT Ministry) to 
implement the Readiness Assessment Methodology (RAM) in India. Ikigai Law, a technology law and 
policy firm, was engaged as the implementation partner for this initiative.
The RAM in India followed a structured, participatory approach, combining secondary research 
with stakeholder consultations. A stakeholder mapping exercise was undertaken to ensure broad 
and inclusive representation across India’s socio-economic, regional and institutional landscape. 
Stakeholders were identified across domains such as government, academia, industry and civil society, 
with expertise in areas including AI ethics, public sector deployment and workforce skilling
Between November 2024 and June 2025, six regional consultations were conducted in four cities 
under Chatham House rules to foster open dialogue:
•  New Delhi (14 November 2024; 3 June 2025)
Focused on northern states and union territories: Uttar Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Uttarakhand, 
Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana and the National Capital Region, and Union Government 
stakeholders.
•  Bengaluru (16–17 January 2025)
Focused on western and southern states and union territories, with participants from Gujarat, 
Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Lakshadweep, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu, and the 
Andaman and Nicobar Islands, with one session dedicated to the start-up ecosystem.
•  Hyderabad (8 April 2025)
Focused on Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala.

### Page 68

55
•  Guwahati (9 May 2025)
Focused on eastern and north-eastern states: Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland, 
Arunachal Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal.
More than 600 individuals participated, including public officials, academics, start-ups, technology 
firms, civil society organizations and think tanks. Targeted outreach, open registration and nomination-
based inclusion ensured diversity, including of under-represented geographies and communities.
To contextualize the RAM framework within India’s policy and institutional landscape, four core 
thematic pillars were jointly identified by the IT Ministry, UNESCO and Ikigai Law. These themes 
reflected core elements of the RAM framework and were chosen based on their relevance to India’s 
current AI landscape and offered a practical structure to organize stakeholder dialogue.
The four thematic pillars were:
•  Governance
Addressed the RAM’s emphasis on legal and regulatory frameworks, focusing on AI-specific policies, 
data protection, accountability frameworks and institutional capacity.
•  Sectoral use cases
Explored ethical AI adoption in key sectors such as healthcare, agriculture, language preservation, and 
education, drawing from the RAM’s social and cultural dimensions.
•  Workforce
Reflected the RAM’s education and economic indicators, including skilling initiatives, labour market 
trends, funding for AI research and development, and inclusion in AI-driven transformation.
•  Infrastructure and investment
Aligned with the RAM’s focus on technical and institutional capacity, focused on India’s digital public 
infrastructure, compute capabilities, environmental sustainability efforts, and investment in AI.
Each RAM consultation was structured in two segments. The first was a public-facing session featuring 
senior government officials from the IndiaAI Mission and hosting state governments, representatives 
from international organizations and AI experts, who emphasized the importance of ethics, safety 
and inclusive governance in shaping India’s AI future. This segment also served to raise awareness 
about the IndiaAI Mission, the objectives of the RAM process, and India’s broader commitment to 
the responsible development and deployment of AI. As part of this segment, selected projects under 
the Mission’s Safe & Trusted AI pillar were showcased, illustrating practical efforts to embed ethical 
principles into AI tools and applications. The second segment comprised closed-door, theme-based 
breakout discussions. Participants were grouped according to domain expertise and engaged in 
moderated discussions guided by structured questionnaires contextualized from the RAM framework. 
These sessions were designed to surface grounded, context-specific insights across thematic areas, 
including AI governance, infrastructure and investment, workforce readiness, and sectoral use cases.
While the RAM draws on qualitative techniques for data collection and synthesis, it also supports 
diagnostic insights and policy-making. It is not intended to produce generalizable or theory-driven 
conclusions, and the stakeholder findings presented in this report are indicative of prevailing views 
among participants at the time of the assessment. They are meant to guide future implementation 
of the UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence and inform future policy 
formulation and the ethical governance of AI in India.

CHAPTER 8
Findings from the multistakeholder consultations
This section synthesizes insights from the national stakeholder consultations, offering a view of how AI is 
perceived to be evolving by key stakeholders across India. Participants reflected not only on regulatory 
gaps and implementation challenges, but also on areas of progress across India’s AI ecosystem, sharing 
their own perspectives about their roles, the challenges they face and the opportunities they would 
like to seize. Rather than seeking consensus, the consultations focused on having a broad range of 
stakeholders’ experiences, priorities and concerns emerge, with a view to accounting for and reflecting 
the complexity of India’s AI landscape. The findings of these consultations are organized around four 
areas: AI governance and policy; enablers and barriers to AI adoption; preparing India’s workforce for 
the AI era; and infrastructure and investment. In what follows, the findings refer to both enablers and 
tensions underpinning India’s journey towards ethical and inclusive AI development, deployment and use.
AI governance and policy in India
Policies and governance
Stakeholders emphasized the need for governance frameworks that enable innovation while addressing 
potential risks associated with AI deployment. In particular, a widespread observation emerged 
in relation to the need for clear, flexible, principle-based approaches that can adapt to, different 
technological advancements and application contexts. Stakeholders argued in favour of governance 
structures balancing clear principles, such as transparency, accountability and safety, with sector-
specific considerations based on the intended use, operational context and potential risks or harms of 
AI systems throughout their life cycles. A model combining industry-led standards with government 
steering and oversight was widely viewed as suitable for India’s evolving AI ecosystem.
However, several participants cautioned that overly prescriptive or rigid risk-based frameworks 
applied in other jurisdictions may not be well-suited to India’s developing AI ecosystem. Instead, they 
recommended contextual approaches to governance. Developers, including start-up and industry 
representatives, highlighted that sectors like finance and healthcare may experience gradual and 
complex shifts in risk profiles, requiring continuous monitoring and periodic recalibration of risk 
assessments.
Stakeholders noted that current frameworks may, at times, lack practical tools and guidance for 
operationalization, particularly for smaller firms and start-ups. Responsibility and liability across the AI 
value chain emerged as a key concern, with several stakeholders calling for greater clarity on the roles 
of developers, deployers and other intermediaries involved in the design and application of AI systems.
To support consistent implementation, participants expressed support for the government’s whole-
of-government approach to harmonizing AI-related policies across sectors. Cross-sector training 
programmes and the development of a shared terminology or lexicon were recommended as ways to 
strengthen coordination between regulatory and technical actors.
Stakeholders, especially across industry and start-ups, noted that existing legal frameworks seemed 
capable of addressing a range of AI-related harms and were supportive of the government’s current 
approach, but called for greater clarity on the applicability and enforcement of laws across sectors. 
They also recognized that the evolving risks and harms associated with greater AI adoption will require 
THEME

the government to undertake comprehensive evaluations of the adequacy of current laws and act 
accordingly, to promote trust in the technology.
Addressing coordination with and among states and disparities in capacity
Stakeholders emphasized that a whole-of-government approach to AI governance would require 
strengthening coordination between the central and state governments. They observed that many 
state agencies require increased capacity and technical expertise to effectively develop and deploy 
AI technologies. Participants also noted disparities in AI readiness, with innovation ecosystems mainly 
concentrated in a few metropolitan hubs. To address this imbalance, they underscored the importance 
of expanding AI-related development, infrastructure and access more evenly across states to contain 
deepening digital divides, and the need to ensure more equitable participation in AI-related schemes, 
funding and opportunities across the country.
State government officials, while reiterating the importance of national frameworks that support local 
innovation, called for more direct involvement of states in AI policy-making, especially to reflect regional 
priorities and challenges. Mechanisms proposed by stakeholders to facilitate this included: the formation 
of inter-state councils for cooperation and cross-learning related to digital technologies including AI; 
the establishment of state-level AI working groups under the Digital India framework; and greater state 
representation in national decision-making bodies. 
Procurement
Participants underscored the need for structured AI procurement-related guidelines and implementation 
at both state and national levels, enabling responsible and ethical AI to be developed and deployed. They 
emphasized that ethical considerations should be carefully and consultatively embedded, alongside 
technical and institutional considerations. AI procurement, they noted, should align with public interest 
and aim to minimize harm. Given the cross-sectoral impact of AI technologies, stakeholders also 
recommended expert-led, multistakeholder consultations throughout procurement life cycles.
Besides underlining the need to strengthen public sector capacity related to AI procurement, participants 
cautioned that unresolved capacity gaps could result in delays and ineffective procurement decisions. 
Given that government and government-linked institutions could be one of the biggest procurers of AI 
systems, their procurement practices could significantly influence the development of industry norms, 
including benchmarks for safe and ethical deployment. To support more transparent and accountable 
processes, stakeholders suggested the introduction of standardized procurement requirements, auditing 
and certification protocols, and ethical benchmarks.
AI adoption: enablers and barriers
A call to enhance data availability and quality
Several stakeholders observed that large volumes of government data remain underutilized due to the 
lack of clear protocols for their public access or release. In sectors such as health and education, while 
data are regularly collected, they are often inaccessible due to overly cautious disclosure practices and, 
when accessible, may turn out to be of insufficient quality (including issues of coverage and unbalanced 
or insufficient representation). Participants also emphasized the need to improve the quality of available 
datasets, and to resolve issues that may impact the design, deployment, accuracy and effectiveness of AI 
systems, such as unstructured formats, incomplete records or incorrect annotations, especially in sectors 
like healthcare and agriculture.
THEME

Beyond technical accuracy, stakeholders emphasized the importance of creating datasets that better 
represent India’s cultural, linguistic and regional diversity. This was seen as essential for developing 
AI systems that can support localized and inclusive service delivery and, more generally, make AI 
systems better fit for purpose when applied. While there was broad consensus on the importance of 
safeguarding privacy, participants called for more flexible and effective approaches to anonymization, 
ones that preserve relevant contextual information without compromising individual privacy (e.g. 
micro-aggregation). The importance of ethical data collection practices were also emphasized, 
including consensus, the use of participatory methods, and the provision of fair compensation to 
individuals or communities contributing data for the common good or for commercial use.
To address persistent data gaps in sectors where commercial incentives are limited (such as public 
health, agriculture and rural development), participants further recommended the use of public 
funding or, more generally, incentives, to develop high-quality, sector-specific datasets. These efforts, 
they noted, could help create reliable resources for innovation and public-interest applications, 
particularly in underserved but societally important domains.
In addition to the above, institutional coordination in relation to data gathering, access and use 
emerged as a recurring challenge. Stakeholders called for greater attention to improve the governance, 
licensing and accessibility of public datasets. While platforms like AIKosh (India’s AI public dataset 
platform) were acknowledged as valuable infrastructural initiatives, participants noted the need for 
greater attention to awareness, capacity building and onboarding, particularly of government officials, 
researchers and start-ups, to ensure widespread and effective AI deployment and adoption.
Participants highlighted the difficulty of combining and using data that comes from different 
government departments or administrative units. They noted that this challenge often arises from 
a lack of common data standards, which are necessary to ensure that different systems and datasets 
can work together. They argued that such data remained difficult to access or integrate and manage. 
As a possible solution, stakeholders proposed the creation of formal coordination mechanisms, such 
as a data task force under an inter-ministerial coordination committee (IMCC) for AI, aimed to improve 
and streamline data gathering, access, use and governance. This were seen as especially relevant in 
domains like health, education and welfare, where questions of ownership, access and use often span 
multiple ministries, agencies or state governments. Stakeholders further emphasized the need for the 
rules applying to such initiatives to be clear, straightforward and easy to abide by, in order for such 
coordinating mechanisms to meaningfully help economic agents and institutions leverage these data 
to develop applications and products benefiting economies and societies alike. Clarifying these roles 
and responsibilities would further help improve data sharing in different application spheres and help 
reduce inefficiencies across the public data ecosystem.
Increasing trust in AI systems can go a long way towards making the Indian AI ecosystem 
thrive
Stakeholders noted that current levels of AI adoption can be increased by strengthening public trust 
through greater transparency, user-centric design, and inclusive, ethical and responsible deployment 
practices. Participants noted that while technical performance, including careful designing and testing, 
is a must, it should be complemented by greater transparency and clearer communication about how 
AI systems function, the data they rely on, and how they align with relevant legal requirements.
Participants emphasized the need to improve public understanding of AI technologies through 
awareness, education and outreach activities. They noted that many non-technical users often 
interact with AI tools without realizing they are powered by AI or understanding how they function.

### Page 72

59
They called for greater public awareness campaigns that de-jargonize AI concepts and increase 
understanding among citizens. They argued that such awareness campaigns should be delivered in 
local languages and accessible multimedia formats, including through public broadcasting systems 
and offline channels.
Stakeholders noted that the government has an important role to play in building public trust in AI 
systems, particularly by setting clear standards for transparency, accountability and ethical use in the 
deployment of AI by public authorities. 
Enhancing flexibility and radical technological development by supporting AI start-ups
The government’s proactive efforts to support and nurture India’s AI start-up ecosystem were widely 
acknowledged by stakeholders. However, start-up representatives highlighted the need for accessible 
regulatory sandboxes, clearer guidance, and easy-to-implement guardrails for start-ups, particularly 
those operating in sensitive sectors like healthcare, finance and education. Many early-stage companies 
said they were struggling to navigate India’s evolving compliance landscape, and some highlighted 
that lack of sector-specific regulatory clarity was a barrier to innovation.
Start-ups also highlighted the trade-offs in embedding ethics and safety within AI systems in the face 
of market pressure and tight deadlines. Without clear, simple and enforceable standards or meaningful 
incentives, responsible AI principles are frequently deprioritized in early-stage product development. To 
address this, participants called for policy and regulatory approaches that are flexible enough to allow 
for experimentation but remain clearly anchored in accountability-related norms and are sufficiently 
easy to implement.
Start-ups acknowledged the progress in India’s AI funding ecosystem for such ventures, but highlighted 
gaps in financing across the funding life cycle. Investor caution, driven by policy uncertainty and the 
high capital intensity of AI development, continues to limit access to risk-tolerant funding. As a result, 
many promising ventures struggle to move beyond the proof-of- concept stage. Scaling up, too, 
remains a huge challenge for start-ups. To address this, stakeholders recommended expanding public-
private co-investment models, and introducing milestone-linked financing mechanisms to help de-risk 
investment and scale up innovation efforts and output, offering to work with policy-makers to devise 
new or improved ways to support start-ups and nurture the grassroots AI ecosystem of India.
Preparing India’s workforce for AI
Impact on India’s workforce
Stakeholders noted that unlike previous technological transformations, which impacted manual jobs, 
AI’s impact is more severe on cognitive and high-value roles, leading to concerns around job security 
within the workforce, especially in relation to this high-skill subset of occupations. They added that AI 
is transforming sectors such as information technology (IT) and IT-enabled services (ITES), banking and 
finance, automating parts of both entry-level and mid-career roles. This has removed a vital part of on-
job skilling/learning, which forms foundational practices for new entrants into the workforce. Concerns 
were also raised for mid-career workers who may resist exploring new skills. Experts also highlighted 
that the informal sector, despite its large workforce, remains overlooked in AI-readiness efforts. Given 
India’s large and diverse workforce, stakeholders noted that certain sectors, such as customer service, 
software development and routine administrative or data-processing roles, were witnessing large-scale 
job losses due to automation and AI deployment. Their concern centred on whether AI could generate 
THEME

enough new employment opportunities to absorb workers displaced from these roles, especially those 
requiring mid-level digital or cognitive skills.
Participants also argued in favour of clear pathways for professionals transitioning into AI roles, to be 
supported through the deployment of suitably trained instructors. At present, they noted that such 
possibilities were scarce and often completely missing, especially outside major cities. They further 
underlined that structured support, ongoing trainer development and stronger academia-industry 
collaborations could go a long way towards enabling the effective skilling of the workforce.
In relation to upskilling and reskilling, stakeholders’ representatives remarked that building an AI-ready 
workforce requires more than just increasing the number of courses, it calls for rethinking pedagogy and 
curricula, and leveraging qualified and well-trained instructors. Finally, they stressed the need to move 
beyond basic-level coding skills towards more specialized training related to model development, data 
stewardship and ethical AI, at least when training specialists, and the need to better distinguish, and 
thus arrange, relevant training related to basic AI fluency versus true technical competence.
Disparities in access to AI skilling initiatives and education
Consultations highlighted regional disparities in access to AI skilling, with rural and underserved areas 
facing challenges such as limited infrastructure, course availability and regional-language resources. 
Participants noted that some AI-related work is already happening in such regions, particularly in data 
cleaning and content moderation, but with limited support. Structured training programmes were 
suggested to enhance these opportunities and improve employment outcomes.
Government representatives acknowledged the importance of expanding AI skilling beyond English-
speaking metros. Translating and localizing courses was seen as essential to widening participation. 
Stakeholders also emphasized embedding equity, accessibility and multidisciplinary approaches into 
skilling frameworks, and recommended targeted efforts to scale education and close existing gaps in 
digital and technical literacy.
Youth and student participants raised an emerging concern: the over-reliance on generative AI tools 
for learning, especially in writing and research. They noted that this trend is weakening critical thinking 
and diminishing confidence among their peers. Without hands-on experiential learning, students may 
develop a shallow understanding of AI tools, exacerbated by poor awareness of prompt design and 
model limitations.
Public sector capacity building
Finally, public sector capacity building was seen as a critical area requiring immediate attention. 
Stakeholders highlighted the need for greater AI literacy among civil servants, and for more regulatory 
clarity and risk governance within public institutions. Embedding ethical AI principles in government 
training, particularly in sectors like health and education, was deemed essential. Participants urged for 
more collaboration between regulators and industry to co-develop evaluation frameworks and ensure 
public readiness for responsible AI adoption.
Infrastructure and investment
Infrastructure
While participants acknowledged the value of ongoing and past government initiatives aimed at 
making compute infrastructure available, including through the IndiaAI Mission, for example, they 
THEME

### Page 74

61
underlined the need for greater awareness about, and access to, relevant AI infrastructure in non-
metropolitan regions. Stakeholders called for better outreach, expanded infrastructure availability, and 
targeted support to ensure smaller start-ups and early-stage innovators can leverage public compute 
investments to develop their products and services.
Participants also observed that AI innovation is increasingly emerging from smaller cities and semi- 
urban areas, i.e. from beyond conventional tech hubs. To support this, they called for scaling research 
and development (R&D) funding in these regions to levels on par with major metropolitan centres. 
Some participants suggested that India could initially leverage its rich and diverse datasets to build 
AI applications while using foreign compute infrastructure as a stopgap. Others emphasized the 
importance of developing domestic capabilities in parallel, noting that long-term self-reliance would 
require strengthening local supply chains. Strategic international partnerships were viewed as a 
valuable interim solution to support this transition.
Power reliability was further identified as a major constraint when it comes to scaling compute 
infrastructure and developing and deploying AI. To address both infrastructural and environmental 
concerns, participants proposed fostering the adoption of more efficient and tailored-to-the- problem 
compute strategies, such as promoting smaller, energy-optimized AI models and calibrating accuracy 
benchmarks to the needs of specific tasks.
Environmental concerns related to AI infrastructure were prominent in these discussions. Participants 
highlighted the environmental impact of AI technologies and compute infrastructure, particularly 
related to the significant electricity consumption associated with training large models. They noted 
that this could have significant impact, especially when data centres still depend on coal-powered grids. 
Stakeholders underlined the need for comprehensive, life-cycle-based metrics that can help monitor 
the environmental impact of AI and help demonstrate or encourage compliance via sustainability-
related goals and targets.
Stakeholders highlighted that the government may strengthen its current environmental impact 
assessment (EIA) framework by incorporating provisions tailored to AI infrastructure and use. They 
suggested the development of a dedicated EIA framework for AI infrastructure, one that considers 
compute clusters, water usage, and the (also long-term) impact on the ecosystem. This would help align 
the needs of technology with sustainability goals. Stakeholders also proposed other ways forward in 
this regard: establishing minimum renewable energy thresholds for the development and deployment 
of AI systems; and integrating environmental, social, and governance (ESG)- related elements into AI 
procurement and infrastructure planning, to ensure environmentally sustainable growth.
Investment
Stakeholders emphasized that India’s AI ecosystem faces critical investment challenges, particularly 
around the long-term financing and equitable distribution of AI infrastructure. Participants also noted 
the narrow focus of private investment patterns, with funding flowing primarily into AI development 
and enterprise applications in sectors like finance, marketing and logistics. By contrast, socially beneficial 
or public-interest AI projects, such as those focused on healthcare, sustainability or local language 
inclusion, struggled to attract sufficient backing due to lower commercial returns.
Stakeholders noted that the absence of targeted incentives is limiting investments in ethical and 
inclusive AI development. In particular, they highlighted the need for government mechanisms that 
actively promote responsible innovation. These could include procurement policies that embed ethical 
standards, tax incentives for companies developing socially beneficial AI, and structured public-private 
partnerships aimed at building shared AI infrastructure.

CHAPTER 9
Policy recommendations 
India’s AI ecosystem is both rapidly evolving and deeply dynamic, with activity across sectors, segments 
and policy areas. There is strong momentum to harness AI for the public good, from improving service 
delivery and boosting productivity to addressing complex developmental and societal challenges. 
At the same time, as this RAM process revealed, there is widespread recognition that AI must be 
developed and deployed in a manner that is ethical, safe, inclusive and accountable.
The following policy directions are grounded in insights gathered through the RAM process and 
build on existing initiatives in India. Each direction examines an issue or challenge and is paired with 
actionable roadmaps that suggest how it can be addressed. These roadmaps are designed to be 
modular, allowing for phased implementation, and aim to build on existing initiatives rather than 
duplicate them.
Ensure informed AI governance across sectors through comprehensive 
evidence-based risk and legal review
RECOMMENDATION
1
While India has taken a measured approach to AI governance, so far, the increasing integration of AI 
across sectors brings a growing range of complex risks, spanning technical failures, ethical concerns, 
societal harms, legal ambiguities, economic disruptions, environmental costs and national security 
threats. Without a standardized framework to identify, classify and assess these risks, governance 
efforts may become fragmented and inconsistent. 
During consultations, stakeholders highlighted that a lack of research on AI risks and the absence of 
a common taxonomy on harms may result in fragmented regulation, overlaps and gaps in oversight, 
and inconsistent treatment of similar risks. To address this, it is recommended that India conduct a 
comprehensive AI risk-mapping exercise and develop a shared risk/harm taxonomy. Further, a gap 
analysis of existing legal frameworks may also be taken up, as suggested in the short-term action 
plan of the AI Governance Guidelines.417 These steps will clarify the scope and severity of AI-related 
risks, and help ensure more consistent, proportionate and adaptable regulatory responses across 
sectors.
RATIONALE
India’s AI Safety Institute may undertake a comprehensive AI risk-mapping and 
taxonomy development exercise
The AI Safety Institute (AISI), in consultation with both the AI governance group and the 
technology and policy expert committee proposed under the AI Governance Guidelines, may 
initiate a coordinated, cross-sectoral study to map and assess emerging and existing AI-related 
risks. This exercise should be undertaken in collaboration with academic institutions, industry 
stakeholders, civil society, and policy think tanks. A key input into this risk mapping process

may be an AI incident repository, as recommended in the AI Governance Guidelines, which 
would collect real-world examples of AI failure or harm.418 Drawing from such case studies, 
the risk mapping exercise should distinguish between anticipated risks, where the likelihood 
and severity are not yet realized, and documented harms, which offer empirical evidence of 
misuse or system failure. This differentiation is critical to support tiered responses based on 
probability, impact and time horizon (immediate, medium- and long-term).
Building on the outcomes of this study, India may develop a standardized, multidimensional 
taxonomy for AI risks and harms. Such a framework can ensure a consistent, structured approach 
to AI governance. It should enable classification of risks by nature, severity, sector and context, 
and support alignment across policy-makers, developers, regulators and oversight bodies. 
The taxonomy should capture a broad spectrum of risk domains, including technical, ethical, 
legal, societal, economic, environmental and national security dimensions. Global reference 
models such as the OECD AI Incidents Monitor,419 the United States’ NIST AI Risk Management 
Framework,420 and the MIT’s AI Risk Repository421 may serve as reference templates, with 
necessary adaptation to India’s institutional and developmental context. Domestic efforts in 
this regard, such as the Telecom Engineering Centre (TEC’s) initiative to map AI-related failures, 
can also serve as important reference points for this exercise.
An analysis of existing laws and their efficacy in addressing AI risks and harms 
may be undertaken by relevant authorities, in collaboration with the proposed AI 
governance group
The AI Governance Guidelines have addressed the importance of identifying legal ambiguities 
and surfacing stakeholder perspectives on how existing laws apply to AI-related harms. Building 
on this initial groundwork, India may consider undertaking a comprehensive legal review to 
assess how existing frameworks address the risks identified through a risk-mapping exercise. 
The review can map identified risks against current frameworks such as the Information 
Technology Act, 2000, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA), 2003, criminal laws, 
consumer protection laws, and relevant sectoral regulations. The objective is to distinguish 
between 
•  risks that are unregulated and may require new governance frameworks;
•  risks that are partially covered but need reinterpretation or strengthening; and
•  risks that are already adequately addressed. 
This study can be led by relevant authorities, in collaboration with the AI governance group 
proposed in the AI Governance Guidelines. The mandate of this group includes, among others, 
to ‘study the emerging risks of AI, regulatory gaps, and need for legal amendments’.

Co-develop guidelines for operationalizing ethical AI principles for  
AI developers and deployers 
RECOMMENDATION
2
During consultations, stakeholders highlighted that translating high-level ethical AI principles 
such as fairness, accountability, transparency and safety into actionable AI practices remains a key 
barrier to ethical and effective deployment of AI. Without practical tools or guidance, developers 
and deployers often struggle to integrate these principles into design and implementation life cycles.
Recognizing these challenges, India has already begun supporting the development of practical, 
techno-legal solutions through initiatives under the IndiaAI Mission. Under the Safe & Trusted 
AI pillar, the government has issued two expressions of interest (EOIs) to develop tools, frameworks 
and self-assessment mechanisms tailored to India’s institutional and developmental context. 
The establishment of the IndiaAI Safety Institute further advances this objective, serving as the 
national anchor institution for guiding responsible AI development and helping convert ethical 
principles into operational practices across sectors. Building on these initiatives, India may continue 
to expand and institutionalize such tools to ensure that practical, implementable mechanisms for 
ethical AI become widely accessible across the ecosystem.
RATIONALE
The AI Safety Institute, in collaboration with private entities, may establish 
a voluntary repository of ethical AI practices 
The AI Safety Institute (AISI), under the IndiaAI Mission, may establish a dynamic, publicly 
accessible repository of existing practices for operationalizing and contextualizing ethical 
principles according to India’s needs. In doing so, the AISI may be empowered to conduct 
research, analysis and testing, collaborate with international bodies, support industry 
compliance and contribute to the development of standards. This platform can enable 
governments, AI developers/companies and researchers to voluntarily contribute their existing 
ethical AI practices. The repository can include both sector-agnostic best practices (e.g. model 
documentation standards, bias mitigation strategies, data governance protocols) and sector-
specific examples (e.g. fairness audits in lending, consent protocols in health AI) along with 
implementational manuals. It may also include toolkits to support the integration of ethics 
and safety considerations into AI workflows. Participation may be voluntary to encourage 
openness, and non-monetary incentives like recognition may be considered for contributors.

The IndiaAI Mission, line ministries and sectoral regulators may establish regulatory 
sandboxes for AI developers to embed ‘ethics by design’ into AI systems
India’s AI ecosystem continues to drive innovation across sectors, but many developers and 
deploying entities face uncertainty due to evolving regulatory frameworks and limited access 
to mechanisms for embedding ethical AI practices. To address this, India may consider adopting 
regulatory sandboxes tailored to AI, which serve as time-bound, controlled environments that 
allow AI systems to be tested under regulatory supervision while maintaining flexibility and 
legal clarity. These sandboxes could be co-developed by line ministries, sectoral regulators 
and the IndiaAI Mission, focusing on high-impact domains such as healthcare, education, 
financial services and agriculture. The sectoral Centres of Excellence (CoEs) established by the 
government may serve as institutional anchors for these sandboxes and can be supported 
by the AISI. Together, they can provide domain expertise, technical infrastructure, a platform 
for stakeholder collaboration, and, more importantly, practical pathways to embed ethical AI 
principles at the design stage. 
Such sandboxes would support iterative learning, facilitate dialogue between developers 
and regulators, anticipate risks and harms, and generate evidence to inform future policy and 
standard setting.
and civil society organizations, may collaboratively propose voluntary, sector-appropriate 
commitments that strengthen accountability and build public trust. These commitments 
could take a graded approach, with more robust expectations for high-risk or widely deployed 
systems and flexibility for lower-risk developers. The IndiaAI Mission may support these 
efforts by offering a convening platform, facilitating dialogue where needed and amplifying 
promising industry-led practices. It may also raise awareness of such voluntary measures 
through targeted outreach programmes such as industry webinars, developer meetups, start-
up incubator collaborations, technical workshops, and engagement with industry associations 
[e.g. the National Association of Software and Service Companies (Nasscom), the Federation 
of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FICCI) and the Confederation of Indian Industry 
(CII)].
Several industry-led resources on responsible AI have also been supported or facilitated by the 
IndiaAI Mission, such as Nasscom’s Responsible AI Playbook.

Consider establishing dedicated centre–state coordination mechanisms on AI 
policy planning and implementation
Given the increasingly important role of states in deploying AI for public services, India may 
constitute dedicated coordination mechanisms, such as joint task forces or working groups, 
that facilitate regular engagement between state governments and relevant central ministries. 
A new mechanism could draw on the structure and functioning of the inter-ministerial 
coordination committee (IMCC) for AI (anchored by the Ministry of Electronics and Information 
Technology and the Office of the Principal Scientific Adviser, to increase horizontal coordination 
among departments/ministries of various sectors) as a blueprint for coordinated governance, 
while being tailored specifically to centre-state collaboration. These bodies would support 
alignment on AI priorities, share operational lessons from state-level deployments, and ensure 
consistency in the application of national guidance. For example, such a mechanism could 
encourage states to collaborate with the IndiaAI Mission in making compute infrastructure 
available; in contributing targeted, state-specific datasets to the AIKosh datasets platform; and 
in co-developing applications for addressing a state's unique problems. 
Including experts from industry, academia and civil society may also support these mechanisms 
by providing technical inputs, identifying sector-specific challenges and opportunities, and 
enabling multistakeholder engagement.
Strengthen centre–state coordination for AI governance  
and implementation
RECOMMENDATION

Effective AI governance in India will benefit from deeper coordination between the Union 
Government and states, not only in implementation but also in planning, and in building capacity 
and infrastructure. Consultations highlighted that several states have already launched independent 
AI missions, policies or pilot projects, demonstrating strong local interest and initiative. 
Given the regional diversity of India’s AI ecosystem, effective implementation will require a 
governance model that combines national direction with local flexibility. This will enable states to 
tailor AI strategies to their specific institutional capacities, development priorities and demographic 
realities. To achieve this, the IndiaAI Mission may establish formal mechanisms to coordinate with 
states for sharing best practices and developing policy feedback loops, and to mainstream AI ethics 
and safety considerations in both national and state AI initiatives.

Increase access to AI-ready public sector data through dedicated AI data offices 
and certified officers
India’s National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy (2012)422 encourages the establishment 
of data offices across ministries and departments, a recommendation further supported by the 
Expert Group Report on IndiaAI, which calls for dedicated ‘data management units’423 and the 
IndiaAI mission’s initiative to create Data Curation Units across different ministries. Stakeholders 
also noted that several states are setting up similar offices or appointing data officers to improve 
departments to support AI-related policy planning and implementation. To complement such 
efforts, the IndiaAI Mission, in collaboration with relevant authorities and state governments, 
may consider publishing modular guidance documents that articulate overarching national AI 
principles and priorities, while providing customizable templates for state-level action plans. These 
toolkits could include adaptable procurement norms, implementation checklists and sample 
governance structures for setting up state-level AI cells. Additionally, they may offer guidance 
on institutional roles, staffing models and coordination mechanisms with central agencies. The 
objective is to equip states with practical, scalable tools and structures to advance AI adoption 
while ensuring coherence with national frameworks on ethics, inclusion and responsible AI use. 
Leverage the AIKosh platform to increase access to high-quality  
datasets for AI development 
RECOMMENDATION
4
This RAM identifies the availability of contextual, high-quality and representative Indian datasets 
as essential for developing AI systems that reflect the country’s diversity. India has already made 
significant progress to address this with the launch of AIKosh, a central platform under the IndiaAI 
Mission that aims to aggregate and democratize access to anonymized, non-personal datasets 
from both public and private sectors. By enabling collaborative data curation, iterative refinement 
through versioning, and direct usability of datasets in AI applications, AIKosh aims to accelerate 
responsible AI development across sectors. However, the onboarding of datasets remains a 
challenge, as the need for greater data handling capacity in the public sector and hesitation due to 
intellectual property and competition concerns in the private sector have limited their contributions 
to public data repositories. Importantly, there remains a critical need to ensure that datasets reflect 
the diversity of India’s population and contexts, particularly across under-represented regions, 
languages and demographic groups, to mitigate bias and improve the relevance and inclusiveness 
of AI models deployed in the country.
It is recommended that India scale up its efforts to strengthen the AIKosh platform by increasing 
dataset contributions from both public and private sectors. This must go beyond volume to ensure 
that datasets are responsibly collected, well-documented and reflective of India’s socio-economic 
and linguistic diversity.

Enable state participation in AI development through dataset contributions
States can also play a significant role in strengthening India’s AI ecosystem. They may deepen 
collaboration with the IndiaAI Mission by contributing non-sensitive datasets to AIKosh, such 
as those pertaining to agriculture patterns, local languages and heritage, public health trends, 
mobility and transport usage, environmental and climate conditions, disaster-risk indicators, 
education outcomes and service delivery. Such contributions would help build culturally and 
economically representative datasets for AI development. 
States may be encouraged to participate through targeted incentives or support programmes, 
including technical assistance for data standardization, capacity building for state government 
departments, support for development of applications trained on such datasets, and 
recognition mechanisms for states that contribute meaningfully to the national AI ecosystem.
data-driven policy-making. To enhance the AI use-worthiness of public sector data and expand 
their availability on AIKosh, the IndiaAI Mission may provide technical guidance, standardization 
protocols and training to data offices focused on curating datasets suitable for AI applications. 
In line with the IndiaAI Expert Group Report, government departments can be guided through 
a step-by-step process, beginning with: 1. identification of high-value datasets; 2. assessment 
of their structure, completeness and privacy requirements; 3. cleaning and standardizing data 
formats, annotating metadata and applying anonymization protocols; 4. validating datasets 
for AI usability; and finally, 5. making these AI-ready datasets accessible through secure, 
governed channels for use in research, innovation and public service delivery. To support this 
institutional capacity, the IndiaAI Mission, in collaboration with AI developers and experts, may 
also develop a formal certification pathway for AI data officers.
4.2
The IndiaAI Mission may develop frameworks for voluntary, non-sensitive data 
sharing from the private sector on the AIKosh platform
Private sector participation in India’s dataset platform offers a valuable opportunity to 
strengthen the AI ecosystem. However, resistance to data sharing stems from legitimate 
concerns around privacy, confidentiality and proprietary interests. In 2025, the government 
invited an expression of interest (EOI) from non-governmental organizations to contribute 
non-personal, anonymized and India-specific datasets to AIKosh. The EOI outlines objectives, 
eligibility and the submission process for dataset contributors, with a focus on responsible data 
governance and alignment with national data laws and ethical AI principles. Building on this, 
the government may work with industry to create a voluntary framework that makes it easy 
and safe for companies to share non-sensitive datasets, such as sectoral trend data, industrial 
activity, environmental and sustainability indicators, logistics and supply-chain patterns, or 
industry-specific metadata that can support research and innovation without compromising 
proprietary information or individual privacy. To encourage participation, the government 
could introduce incentives that reward firms contributing data, such as certification or labelling 
(e.g. ‘Trusted Data Contributor’), onboarding for capacity-building programmes on AI data 
management, visibility opportunities in national reports and showcases, and opportunities to 
participate in pilot projects, regulatory sandboxes or expert working groups.

The IndiaAI Safety Institute to guide public-sector adoption of transparency and 
accountability measures in AI systems
The IndiaAI Safety Institute (AISI) can play a central role in guiding transparency and 
accountability across public-sector AI use. As recommended in the Competency Framework for 
AI Integration in India,424 published by the IndiaAI Mission, sub-committees may be set up in 
collaboration with the AISI to help develop baseline guidelines for meaningful transparency, 
including standardized templates for model cards, system fact sheets and AI impact 
assessments. These tools would document key attributes such as intended use, limitations, 
performance benchmarks and the nature of non-proprietary training data. 
Importantly, as noted in the competency framework, explanations should not be limited 
to technical audiences but must also be accessible to non-technical stakeholders, ensuring 
clarity, public understanding and accountability. A central repository may also be established 
to publish documentation for AI systems deployed in the public sector, in accessible formats 
and regional languages. This would support consistent ethical AI practices across states and 
agencies, while enabling citizens to understand how AI is being used in public services.
Advance public trust in AI through governance, procurement  
and awareness
RECOMMENDATION

While the benefits of AI are increasingly visible across sectors in India, concerns around its risks and 
potential harms have also led to trust issues, especially in a context of unequal digital literacy. While 
data indicated optimism around the usage of AI, stakeholder consultations highlighted that public 
trust may be weakened by the lack of better understanding of how AI systems work, how personal 
data is used, and what safeguards exist for users. This uncertainty often leads to confusion, fear 
and resistance. As a major adopter of, and standard setter for AI, the Indian Government is uniquely 
positioned to set baseline norms for responsible AI use. By embedding transparency features in its 
own AI use and investing in public awareness, it can build trust, set clear standards and show what 
responsible deployment looks like. This will not only boost public confidence but also create a culture 
of accountability and user-first design across the AI ecosystem.

Relevant authorities may develop model AI procurement guidelines for public 
sector adoption of AI systems
Public procurement can serve as a strategic lever to embed ethical AI practices into government 
use of AI systems. As the adoption of AI tools for public service delivery accelerates, embedding 
ethical and technical evaluation in procurement processes is critical to ensure safety, fairness 
and public trust. To operationalize this, relevant authorities, in consultation with NITI Aayog and 
the IndiaAI Mission, may consider developing model AI procurement guidelines that cover both 
technical and ethical components, focusing on technical robustness, data governance, bias and 
fairness considerations, transparency requirements, cybersecurity safeguards and life-cycle risk 
management. To maintain continuity, these model guidelines can build on existing processes 
followed by central and state governments. Additionally, to improve technical capacity during 
evaluation of public procurement, the government may consider developing an accredited list 
of technical experts, including AI researchers, engineers and ethics professionals, who can be 
consulted during procurement processes such as tender design, evaluation and finalization. 
In this context, reference toolkits developed by international organizations – including UNESCO’s 
Ethical Impact Assessment425 – can act as supplementary guidance to help government 
departments consider and address potential ethical concerns in public procurement processes

The RAM consultations highlighted that while India is making strong strides in AI skilling, key 
challenges persist. Skills gaps, job displacement risks and a shortage of qualified AI educators remain 
key concerns. Many mid-career professionals lack clear upskilling pathways, while informal workers 
and those outside metro cities face limited access to quality AI education. In addition, the public 
sector needs to strengthen its ability to procure, govern and deploy AI responsibly, considering the 
growing emphasis on AI governance and AI-powered public service delivery. 
There is also a need to shift focus from AI fluency to AI competence, to improve employability and 
align with market expectations. Ethics and safety in AI must be integral parts of these programmes 
to ensure an AI workforce that is both competent and ethically aware. To prepare for this shift, India 
should adopt a three-pronged approach: evaluate ongoing efforts; build AI competence and ethical 
AI knowledge across sectors, including the public sector; and anticipate labour market transitions

Indian AI Centres of Excellence may collaborate and prepare ‘training the trainers’ 
programmes for both public and private sectors, across levels
The shortage of qualified educators and trainers with practical, hands-on experience was 
identified as a significant concern during the RAM consultations. In line with the NPAI-SF, 
a structured and continuous national training programme may be developed to upskill 
AI educators. This programme can cover both technical competencies, such as model 
development, data governance and machine learning operations, and cross-cutting areas like 
ethics, bias mitigation and responsible deployment. India can leverage its network of AI Centres 
of Excellence (CoEs) to focus on AI and the future of work in their sectors. The CoEs can anchor 
industry-academia collaboration on workforce transitions, trainer skilling and curriculum 
innovation. The CoEs may also conduct research and labour market impact assessments to

As India scales up AI adoption, there is a critical need to address environmental sustainability. 
The rising environmental footprint of large-scale AI systems, including data centres and compute 
clusters, requires that sustainability be embedded into infrastructure planning from the outset. This 
includes integrating clean energy solutions, encouraging the use of energy-efficient AI models and 
developing regulatory mechanisms to assess environmental impact.
To ensure long-term equity and resilience, infrastructure expansion must be coupled with targeted 
research and development (R&D) support and innovation funding beyond metro hubs, enabling 
the emergence of grassroots innovation ecosystems. Strengthening local compute capacity, 
fostering applied AI research and enabling sustainable design practices are essential to building an 
AI ecosystem that is not only nationally scalable but also environmentally and socially responsible.

guidelines. In December 2024, the Telangana AI Mission convened a multistakeholder 
consultation to seek expert feedback on operationalizing these guidelines for public  
sector use. See Telangana AI Mission LinkedIn Post: https://www.linkedin.com/company/
telangana-ai-mission/posts/?feedView=all. Tamil Nadu's Safe and Ethical Policy, 2020 also  
has a section on ‘Guidelines for procuring AI systems in Tamil Nadu’. It states that the state 
government’s agencies must assess AI systems using a standardized ethics score,  
update the score every six months, store it on a government-managed blockchain,  
and reject systems that don’t meet the required ethical benchmarks.

412 Data use: Statistics have value only if they are used. So the first pillar is data use. A successful 
statistical system produces data that are used widely and frequently. Data services: A range of 
services connects data users to producers and facilitate dialogues between them, thus building 
trust and a sense of value. Data products: The dialogues between users and producers drive the 
design and range of statistical products and their accuracy, timeliness, frequency, comparability 
and levels of disaggregation. The products signal whether countries are able to produce 
indicators related to the seventeen Sustainable Development Goals. Data sources: To create useful 
products, the statistical system needs to draw on sources inside and outside the government. 
Data collection thus goes beyond the typical censuses and surveys to include administrative 
and geospatial data as well as data generated by private firms and citizens. Data infrastructure: 
A mature statistical system has well-developed hard infrastructure (legislation, governance, 
standards) and soft infrastructure (skills, partnerships) as well as the financial resources to deliver 
useful – and widely used – data products and services.
