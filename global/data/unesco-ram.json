The social and cultural dimension focus on factors ensuring inclusiveness and social and cultural diversity, public awareness and values related to the scaling up of ethical AI solutions. Ensuring that AI systems do not contribute to the amplification of structural bias. This section therefore focuses on issues of gender inequality and the bias that may arise from a lack of representativity in datasets and embedded biases in algorithmic systems, due to a lack of diversity and gender equality in the teams designing and producing AI systems. DIVERSITY, INCLUSION AND EQUALITY According to recent data from the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), in regions with higher internet usage, such as the Americas, gender parity in internet access has been achieved or is near achievement. This is evident in many Caribbean nations, including Antigua and Barbuda, where the overall internet usage rate is relatively high, and the gender parity score is close to 1.0, signalling near equality in access between men and women (ITU, 2023). SIDS, including Antigua and Barbuda, are unique in that they tend to have a higher gender parity score compared to other low- income or less developed regions. While global averages show men using the internet more than women (70% men vs. 65% women), small island nations have a parity score close to 0.97, and in some cases, women even outnumber men in internet usage (ITU, 2023). However, it is essential to note that while Antigua and Barbuda and many Caribbean nations show progress, disparities still exist in terms of meaningful inte",

By implementing these strategies, Antigua and Barbuda can further improve its e-government development and enhance the delivery of public services to its citizens. When participants in the RAM consultations were asked about their trust in Government websites, one participant noted “I don’t think it’s a general trust. It’s just the data. How accurate and up to date is it?” This suggests that once information is current and truthful, it will be considered reliable and worthwhile for use. In terms of trust in AI, many participants of the multistakeholder consultations expressed scepticism about AI, particularly among older audiences who remain cautious about fully relying on AI systems. In contrast, younger individuals – who also engaged in a dedicated youth-focused consultation - are more enthusiastic about AI but raised concerns about over-reliance. This concern may also indicate the right mindset that is necessary for responsible use. Public trust in both government websites and AI can be built through transparency, regular updates, and clear communication. ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY POLICIES The Environmental Protection & Management Act of 2019 sets the groundwork for environmental protection in Antigua and Barbuda. Although it doesn’t directly mention AI, it could potentially guide the creation and implementation of AI solutions in fields such as environmental surveillance, resource administration, and pollution mitigation. Other laws such as the Fisheries Act of 2006, could be extended to include AI. Antigua and Barbuda recognises that AI for sustainability is a priority and can support environmental goals, such as climate resilience and early warning systems. However, the sustainability of AI itself, particularly its carbon footprint and energy use, also needs attention. Currently, there is no policy to",

The scientific and educational aspect of the RAM evaluates the nation’s current capacity in AI research alongside the state of AI-related education. RESEARCH AND INNOVATION Globally, as part of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), countries such as those in the Caribbean have pledged to dedicate at least 1% of the GDP to Gross Expenditure on Research and Development (GERD) to support research and innovation. According to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS), the GERD in 2020 for Latin America and the Caribbean is at 0.63 to 1.05 for SIDS, while the world average is 1.93. Looking at individual countries, there were no statistics for most of the Caribbean countries. Among countries with reported data, Trinidad and Tobago had the GERD of 0.06 in 2019, while Cuba recorded the highest at 0.52 in 2020 (Trading Economics, n.d.). Further details on the GERD can be seen in Table 1 below. Antigua and Barbuda does not have a well-established or any reported data on the GERD. Like many data-scarce regions, this data is available but not readily harvested. While the zero-budget allocation is alarming, it highlights the opportunity to better align developmental agendas with robust and rigorous scientific research. Antigua and Barbuda lacks documented or readily shared data on GERD in natural sciences and engineering as a share of GDP. According to data from Trading Economics website, Trinidad and Tobago does not specify gross expenditure on research and development on natural sciences and engineering as a share of gross domestic product, but the GERD was reported to be 0.05382% of the GDP in 2021; 13.19 USD million.

Available at: https://www.paylab.com/ag/salaryinfo/information-technology/data-scientist?lang=en The economic dimension focuses on the supply side of AI ecosystem. It covers aspects such as the labour market, intermediate consumptions etc. These are crucial aspects for evaluating the performance and readiness of the any country’s AI ecosystem. LABOUR MARKETS There is no figure that accurately reflects the share of job vacancies requiring AI skills (online) in Antigua and Barbuda. In places like Trinidad and Tobago there are over 9,000 remote job vacancies in AI-related skills.4 Similarly to most of the other Caribbean islands there is no publicly confirmed figure about the share of current employees working as data scientists in Antigua and Barbuda. However, according to Paylab, the position of a data scientist in the labour market for information and technology, is ranked 76th based on salary . 5This implies that there, is for sure, a job market for data scientists in Antigua and Barbuda, though there may not be a high demand for them. There is not enough statistical data within the Caribbean region to rank the countries regarding the relative AI skill penetration. According to OECD live data, most studies are focused on the larger Latin American and Caribbean countries like Dominican Republic, which is making a lot of efforts into developing their AI industry. Antigua and Barbuda does not appear in any global or regional rankings for AI talent concentration. The sector remains underdeveloped, resulting in limited data and statistics. However, according to the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC, 2024), a few AI companies have emerged in the Caribbean, particularly in St. Kitts and Nevis",

For this modality, a form was provided with the same guiding questions as for the virtual consultations and 21 additional and optional questions. The collection of information sought to explore specific points related to people´s experience, health, well-being, and familiarity with the opportunities and challenges of AI, such as: i. Have you ever been in an embarrassing situation because of a computer system that you knew was a system error and not a human error (e.g., rejected request, improper login, etc.)? If so, did you receive information or already know how to appeal such a decision? Could you tell us what happened?;; ii. Do you trust your interactions with automated systems and find their results more objective than when you interact with a human?? iii. When it comes to facial recognition, do you feel uncomfortable sharing your facial biometrics? iv. What are the main risks and/or benefits that you can imagine for the use of AI systems in the lives of children and adolescents, including in the school and consumer environments? v. Do you feel that technology has made you happier, more positive, or with less difficult when writing? vi. Do you believe that AI-based technologies, as well as the underlying processes involved in the production and supply chain of these technologies, pose risks to the environment for present and future generations, thereby jeopardizing the UN Sustainable Development Goals?

Recommendations are organized into three main categories: Regulation, Institutional Framework and Human and Institutional Training. 3.1. REGULATION Recommendation 1. Promoting and implementing the UNESCO Recommendation on AI Ethics. In view of the norms contained in the 1988 Federal Constitution, particularly with regard to the promotion of peace, equality, development, democracy and human rights, in all their forms and for all peoples, whether Brazilian or foreign, it is recommended that the Brazilian government continue its efforts to effectively implement the UNESCO Recommendation, with an emphasis on promoting ethics, transparency and respect for human rights in the development and use of AI. Adopting a clear and robust legal framework for AI regulation will help ensure rights protection, sustainable innovation, and alignment with international best practices. In addition, it is recommended to the National Justice Council to incorporate the UNESCO Recommendation on AI Ethics in the update of Resolution No. 332/2020.

The recommendations include both legal and regulatory actions for the short and medium term, including the responsible institutions for their implementation. Assign urgency to the updating of the Personal Data Protection Law and the Cybersecurity and Information Critical Infrastructure Bill The safeguarding of personal data is regarded as a fundamental element in ensuring the effective adherence to the principles and values outlined in UNESCO’s Recommendations. The diagnostic process conducted during the implementation of the RAM raised concerns about the outdated nature of Chile’s current legislation concerning the protection of personal data. Furthermore, ensuring a secure digital ecosystem for the development and ethical use of AI requires addressing cybersecurity threats and treating information as a critical infrastructure. In this regard, two pieces of legislation currently being discussed in parliament should be given urgent priority. The first is the bill that regulates the protection and processing of personal data and creates the Personal Data Protection Agency (bulletins 11144-07 and 11092-07, currently in its third constitutional process). Chile has signed international commitments to update this law, which is vital for ensuring an adequate protection of people’s rights against potential risks in digital environments. The second legislation is the Framework Law on Cybersecurity and Critical Information Infrastructure (bulletin 14847-06, in the second constitutional process), which creates the National Cybersecurity Agency with regulatory, supervisory and sanctioning powers for state agencies and private institutions.

Technical and Ethical Standards: Standards that companies and organisations must adhere to when developing and using AI systems. 7. Creation of an independent body responsible for issuing guidelines and best practices, monitoring and auditing assessments and ensuring overall compliance with the law. In the context of establishing this organisation, it is advisable to initiate discussions with both the legislative branch and the public regarding the importance and specifics of a particular AI bill. To inform these discussions, a comprehensive study should be conducted to examine how AI regulation is evolving in the European Union, the United States, China and other countries that have made significant progress in this area. This analysis should pay particular attention to how these countries are implementing the principles outlined in the UNESCO Recommendation. It is worth noting that global practices vary, with some countries employing specialised agencies, ministries, public-private partnerships, and other approaches. Therefore, we must carefully consider the most suitable approach for Chile’s specific circumstances. Responsible Institutions: MSTKI Timeframe: 2023 – 2024 Explore Regulatory Experimentation Mechanisms (e.g., Sandboxes) for the Application of AI in Critical Areas Regulation can arrive late in rapidly developing technological fields, such as AI, and can increase the costs of innovation if it is overregulated. Therefore, It is recommended to promote regulatory experimentation initiatives which allow for the creation of controlled and secure environments in which companies and organisations can test and refine AI solutions with a certain degree of regulatory certainty. Among the different possibilities for regulatory experimentation, the sandbox has garnered more experience in the Latin American context, as years of experience have been accumulated in Colom",

          "text": "Table 5. Example cases of Sandboxes The OECD (2023c) defines regulatory sandboxes as a specific regulatory experimentation tool in which flexibility or waivers are set in place for firms to test new systems with reduced requirements. Sandboxes include mechanisms to protect users and, since they closely connect firms and officials from governing bodies, can also inform policy development. Some characteristics of sandboxes are their temporary nature, trial-and-error approach and collaboration between multiple stakeholders. However, there is no one specific definition nor shape that sandboxes take since they are very context-dependent. Some examples of sandboxes that can inform and inspire the Chilean case are: • Brazil: Recently, the Brazilian National Data Protection Authority opened a call for proposals to create a regulatory sandbox to increase algorithmic transparency, foster AI responsible innovation and inform AI regulation (ANPD, 2023). • Colombia: The government created a supervised space where firms can develop AI tools that are privacy preserving. The sandbox provides a collaborative environment which facilitates testing tools to achieve privacy standards (SIC, 2021). • Korea: A group of four ministries related to economy, science and technology created a sandbox that can provide regulatory waivers to test products, services and business models. While tests are conducted, the data informs government regulation. Since 2019, the sandboxes expanded into special regulation-free zones for some specific sectors and applications (Fintech Center Korea, 2023). Promote ethical principles of AI through purchasing regulations and standards The RAM, in its assessment, highlighted the importance of creating administrative guidelines for procuring data science and AI projects within the public sector as a best practice. Leveraging procurement regulations can be a highly efficient way to integrate key elements of the UNESCO Recommendation in a dynamic manner. With the immin",

Such principles include: proportionality, safety and protection, equity and non-discrimination, human oversight and decision-making, transparency and explainability, as well as accountability and responsibility. Drawing from successful national precedents, it is suggested to contemplate the use of instruments such as presidential guidelines to steer the adoption of ethical principles in the deployment of AI systems within government agencies. The establishment of these guidelines within the public sector could serve as a valuable model for applying these principles across various domains. To promote the sharing of knowledge and the dissemination of lessons learned during its implementation, it is recommended to systematically document and publicise both the process and the outcomes of this experience.

Timeframe: 2024 - 2025 Development of AI Strategies for Local Governments AI strategies primarily focus on national-level developments, presenting significant challenges at the local government level. Conversely, developing AI systems with an emphasis on local communities provides an opportunity to extend AI beyond major cities. It is recommended to formulate AI strategies at the municipal level, following the lead of cities such as Barcelona or Helsinki. To achieve this, given the heterogeneous nature of municipalities, they should commence by evaluating their preparedness to establish a baseline for reference. Considering that this measure remains relatively novel due to limited comparative experience, it is advisable to collaborate with international organisations to facilitate research and pilot development funding in rural local governments. Responsible Institutions: MSTKI and Undersecretariat of Administrative and Regional Development (SUBDERE, by its name in Spanish). Timeframe: 2024-2026. Update Chile’s National AI Policy (NAIP) and Action Plan Although AI governance and institutional structures are robust, NAIP does not explicitly incorporate UNESCO’s Recommendation principles. Therefore, it is recommended to revise the current NAIP to include these principles and any new initiatives arising from this integration. These updating initiatives and recommendations should be formulated based on the findings during the implementation of the RAM and the respective participation sessions conducted within the same context.

The international experience showcases various models, including specialised agencies, ministries and public-private consortia, among others. Considering the current Chilean institutional framework, strengthening the existing governance led by MSTKI and formalising the Inter Ministerial Committee with greater faculties than sporadic consultations is suggested. Additionally, studying the formation of a permanent multi-stakeholder body for the development of recommendations on the ethical use of AI is recommended. This body could consist of actors from the public sector, industry, academia and civil society with an advisory role and the dissemination of best practices. Furthermore, this body can support the promotion and dissemination of public processes that require greater citizen participation. Responsible Institution: MSTKI. Timeframe: Last quarter of 2023 and 2024. Create early assessment mechanisms for the implementation of the NAIP Despite Chile having a wide range of ongoing programs for AI development, it still lacks tracking mechanisms to assess the effectiveness of these measures. Based on the findings from the application of the RAM, it is recommended to establish indicators and mechanisms for monitoring and evaluating the Action Plan and the NAIP. Considering the existing instruments in the country, the use of instances such as the Management Improvement Programme (PMG, by its name in Spanish) is recommended to report the fulfilment of committed actions within the public sector. Additionally, collaboration with multilateral organisations to fund the piloting of evaluation and measurement tools for compliance with these initiatives is recommended.

Promote Integration of Ph.D. Holders into the Industry: Design, pilot, and implement measures to encourage the integration of Ph.D. holders into the industry, with a particular focus on information technologies, including AI. This may involve initiatives such as tax incentives for companies hiring Ph.D. holders, establishing collaborative Ph.D. programs with industry partners, and offering funding for research internships in the industry, among other strategies. e. Allocate Resources for Industry-University Collaboration: Allocate industry-university collaboration funds to support the digital transformation of industries through the application of AI. Prioritise industries with the most significant gaps in digitalization or those where AI implementation promises the highest productivity gains. f. Attract international conferences on AI: One of the gaps identified during the application of RAM is the absence of relevant international conferences on AI or AI ethics in the national territory. Therefore, it is recommended to provide funding to attract and organise high-level conferences on AI and its ethics in the country. g. Evaluate the Digital Transformation Strategy in Education: Monitor and assess the outcomes of the current Digital Transformation strategy in education to gauge its effectiveness and relevance in building human capital for AI. Based on these evaluations and lessons learned, consider the establishment of specific laws or policies related to the use of AI in the education system. h. Collect and Maintain",

Responsible Institutions: Ministry of Environment, MSTKI, and MEDT. Timeframe: 2024 and 2025 Assess the impact of AI and automation on the workforce and define job retraining plans The Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare has initiated a forward-looking process and established a multi-stakeholder working group to address the future of work. To ensure a smooth transition for workers whose roles are impacted by the introduction of AI tools, it is recommended to expedite and enhance these efforts. Specific measures should be devised in the short term to support affected workers, which may include updates to regulations, considering changes in the working relationship between employees and employers, as well as the allocation of funds to assist individuals in their transition and retraining. Simultaneously, alongside the forward-looking discussions, it is advisable to foster a multi-stakeholder dialogue and establish a national cross-sector agreement on the responsible and ethical use of AI. This agreement should outline principles and commitments from all involved parties, signifying a significant milestone where industry, academia, the public sector, and civil society come together to endorse these principles. Subsequently, guidelines for ethical algorithm use within businesses should be developed, with incentives created to encourage companies to adopt or develop these guidelines as part of their ethical codes. Furthermore, in the context of training and certification, it is essential to broaden the public offerings of AI training. This expansion should encompass modules addressing the ethical and responsible use of AI. Additionally, qualifications frameworks should be reinforced by integrating AI-related topics into the Information Technologies training and employment route. Responsible Institutions: Minist",

          "text": "Further, building on initiatives like the study on harmful biases commissioned by the MEDT through APEC and the work on Ethical Algorithms supported by the IADB, it is recommended to create best practice guides and certification systems for the use of AI in government. These guides should cover, at a minimum, best practices related to topics such as citizen participation processes, benefit allocation, alert systems and process automation. Additionally, it is advisable to explore the establishment of a certification system for AI solution providers serving the public sector. Responsible Institutions: SUBDERE, DGD, Government Laboratory. Timeframe: 2025-2026. Creation of a Working Group to Assess the Impact of AI on Culture The application of RAM in Chile has highlighted a noticeable absence of the use and measurement of AI in this field. It is recommended to establish a working group that will produce a report on the potential impact of AI, especially in the context of generative AI, on culture and the creative industries. Based on the content of this report, proposals for actions are expected to be developed for the training and retraining of stakeholders in the cultural ecosystem, as well as for fostering new developments using technological tools. It is suggested to discuss methods of regulatory experimentation in the field of culture, addressing the challenge of new intellectual property regimes that align with international agreements in this area. Considering the lack of data in this area during the implementation of RAM, it is recommended to study the opportunities and impacts of AI systems on the preservation of the country’s cultural heritage and to develop a roadmap to leverage the potential of AI and establish recommendations to protect it from potential harm. Additionally, it is recommended to promote the development of open databases for training models in Chilean Spanish and in the dialects of indigenous peoples of the national territory, with the corre",

The latter applies to having a voice that allows the Cuban reality to be brought to the standards, which are usually dominated by the countries of the Global North. 1.6. Creation of specific guides on the ethical and responsible use of AI in the Cuban context A relevant problem in using AI, especially when the systems are developed primarily in the Global North, is that they do not necessarily adapt to the sociocultural environments of the Global South. Along these lines, it is recommended that use cases that require contextual analysis and issue guides be identified for recommendations and ethical use of AI in these areas.

Along these lines, it must be analysed how automation through AI can generate unemployment and/or modify existing jobs significantly. Furthermore, the same labour relations and required skills change with the emergence of AI-based systems. Cuba should create a policy to address these impacts on the labour market. 1.7.2. Health The RAM detects that, although there are general policies that address general health, AI is not addressed as a specific issue. Along these lines, given the unique opportunities in the field of health as well as the emerging risks in this area, it is recommended to work on a specific sector policy and/or significantly update the existing Public Health policy with a section dedicated to AI. 1.7.3. Culture In the field of culture, AI also presents significant and novel opportunities and risks. On the one hand, the use of AI can foster new forms of art in collaboration with AI or facilitate the protection and preservation of existing cultural heritage. However, this same technology blurs the limits of what creativity, authorship and the minimum subsistence of a cultural identity means that can be lost in the generation of artistic products in an automated way and based on the training of systems. Thus, it is recommended to promote a policy that addresses the use of these technologies in the cultural field and promotes safeguards for artists and Cuban cultural heritage. 1.7.4. Environment In the environmental field, it must be analysed whether the development of AI in Cuba has a significant impact on the environment.",

For data collection, it is recommended that standards and manuals such as those of Frascati and Oslo be followed. In addition, it is urged to review repositories related to the topic, such as the OECD repositories, to identify the indicators that are not being built and the information that is not being collected in the country. In line with the above, it is recommended that standards be followed and that data be reported to the corresponding international organisations (e.g., OECD, World Bank, World Economic Forum, United Nations). This will improve transparency and data quality. 2.2. Collect specific data from the AI ecosystem. It is recommended that data collection on the development and use of AI be promoted, mainly in companies. In particular, information on spending and adoption in the industry and information on employment and skills required for AI-related positions should be collected. To have more disaggregated information, these data must have gender, age, and urban/rural criteria. 26 2.3. Open data policy Cuba has no open data policy and has not signed commitments like the Open Data Charter. In line with the two previous actions, it is recommended that Cuba acquire commitments to open data and advance a policy that makes it public and available on a periodic and transparent basis. It is worth mentioning that it is not enough to publish statistics in a yearbook; we must move towards opening databases in machine-readable format33 , with different download options, clear responsible parties, and adequate metadata that are kept updated and usable. 2.4.

Regulation: Legal and Policy Framework for AI Governance Curaçao must position itself to adopt an AI regulatory framework to govern the ethical and responsible use of AI over time. The first step in this process is the drafting and enactment of a NO on AI, which will set the legal foundation for AI development, deployment, and governance in the country. This legislation will ensure that AI applications in both the public and private sectors adhere to ethical principles, fairness, and non-discrimination while maintaining transparency and accountability. The NO will include AI impact assessments, which will evaluate the risks of AI applications before their deployment in high-risk areas such as public services, healthcare, and law enforcement. To further promote responsible AI development, Curaçao could implement AI regulatory sandboxes. These controlled environments will allow startups and enterprises to test AI applications while gradually working toward full regulatory compliance. The sandbox model will enable experimentation with AI-driven innovations in fields such as healthcare, finance, tourism, and e-government, while ensuring consumer protection and risk mitigation. Additionally, Curaçao must strengthen data privacy and cybersecurity regulations to protect personal data and ensure the safe deployment of AI systems. The existing data protection framework could include more GDPR alignment, ensuring that AI technologies adhere to stringent privacy standards. New cybersecurity regulations should b",

Institutional Framework: Governing AI in Curaçao To effectively regulate and promote AI development, it is recommended that Curaçao organize its AI Oversight across ministries. The agencies responsible will coordinate the oversight on policy implementation, regulatory compliance, and AI funding programs. The initiative will facilitate collaboration between government ministries, universities, private sector partners, and international organizations to ensure that AI development aligns with national economic goals and ethical standards. The AI Oversight should contain an Ethics Committee tasked with conducting AI audits, risk assessments, and ethical evaluations. This Committee will monitor AI systems in critical sectors such as finance, healthcare, and public administration, ensuring that they comply with ethical guidelines. The committee will also develop guidelines on AI fairness, bias detection, and accountability, protecting citizens from potential AI-related harms. To facilitate data-driven AI policymaking, Curaçao will establish an AI Policy Laboratory to help coordinate and assist integrated policy development. This laboratory will collect and analyze data on AI adoption trends, market impact, and research progress. Utilization of real-time data will enable policymakers to make informed decisions about AI regulation, funding priorities, and investment strategies. At the local level, the government can designate AI liaisons in neighborhood centers to oversee AI adoption in smart initiatives, public transportation, and urban planning. These efforts will ensure that AI-driven solutions are tailored to local needs and integrated into public services efficiently. Recommendations – Institutional Framework: Governing AI in Curaçao",

Capacity Building and Training Curaçao must invest in AI education and workforce development to ensure that its citizens have the necessary skills to thrive in an AI-driven economy. A key priority is the integration of AI and Data Science in the national education system, starting from primary school through higher education. The training of teachers is essential to enable the introduction of AI in school curricula covering machine learning, data ethics, and computational thinking, while tertiary-level institutions would offer specialized degrees in AI, robotics, and automation. To accelerate AI skills training for professionals, Curaçao has the opportunity to establish AI training and certification programs within a broader framework for lifelong learning in order to consider the multifaceted aspects of AI. This aims to enable reselling and upskilling to roll out in a responsible and ethical manner. These programs will equip professionals from various industries, including finance, tourism, and healthcare, with practical AI knowledge. The government could also offer reskilling programs for workers at risk of displacement due to automation, ensuring a smooth transition into AI-related jobs. To foster AI innovation and research, the government could enable and facilitate an AI research agenda within the NAIS to promote collaboration between educational institutions and private sector partners, within the scope of the large-scale digitalization project. 31 31 The AI agenda should be centered around applications tailored to Curaçao’s economic landscape, such as AI in sustainable tourism, financial services, and digital governance.

PUBLIC SECTOR CAPABILITIES Although some initiatives aim to strengthen the ICT capabilities of public officials, they are still incipient and do not contemplate mandatory nature or certifications. In this line, having an institutional framework with trained personnel is relevant, so training officials and establishing compulsory and constant updating mechanisms should be a priority. This is partially covered in the ENIA, promoting training for officials and an AI Center of Excellence. The design of incentives is a challenge that needs to be addressed so that certification and education instruments are effectively used 4. DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION POLICIES 4.1. Promote a gender diversity agenda in AI. A significant gender gap was identified in STEM and although there is no data, it can be inferred that AI must be the same or worse, which coincides with existing reports 81 Although the ENIA covers the issue of focusing talent policies, this is not enough. The underrepresentation of women in AI, a significant gender gap identified in STEM, is a pressing issue that must be urgently addressed. According to the RAM, there is no gap in performance but instead in graduates and the prospects of entering the STEM field. Along these lines, work must be done on the design of positive discrimination initiatives, dissemination and visibility of female references in AI, and incentives through public purchases for diversity in teams. 4.2. Promote an agenda with a rural focus. The ENIA does not cover the existing infrastructure gap between rural and urban areas. The development of AI and its use in different areas can increase the gap in terms of quality of life if there is no adequate agenda to address it.

On the one hand, it is recommended to study the uses of AI for culture and heritage preservation, promote positive adoption, and take advantage of its opportunities for creation and preservation. However, the impact often involving regulatory discussions in areas such as those mentioned above regarding intellectual property and copyright must also be addressed. 30 5.2. Drive an agenda on opportunities and impacts of AI on the environment. While mentioned in the ENIA as a potential area from a mission-driven policy perspective, there is no specific prioritisation towards using AI to mitigate the climate crisis. Furthermore, there is no mention of the potential impacts that AI and its development may have on the environment, and no regulation addresses it. Along these lines, it is recommended to start discussions with multiple stakeholders on the relevance of rules around the impact of AI on the environment and move forward with a prioritised agenda both in this sense and in the use of AI for conservation and preservation. It is relevant that the discussion be in-depth and anchored in the local reality. This is because incorrect regulations can curb potential positive uses of AI. For example, the environmental impact assessment generates an extra burden on researchers and entrepreneurs and would only be justified if, in fact, models were being developed in the Dominican Republic, whose high energy consumption could harm the environment. Otherwise, it could be overregulated and end up harming development. 6. DATA COLLECTION 6.1. Collect data on research, development, innovation and entrepreneurship (R+D+i+e).",

These regulations should foster innovation while mitigating potential risks and upholding ethical principles and human rights. ● Enact the draft Law on Personal Data Protection, aligning it with international standards. The draft should be analysed to protect people from data use in the public sector and by the government. ● Revise the Procurement law to adapt to acquiring AI systems safely in government. ● Revise and update the Criminal Code to adequately address specific AI harms not covered in the regulatory framework. Mechanisms of liability and readdress specific to AI harms should be developed. ● Enact a Freedom and Access to Information law: Revise the current draft to incorporate elements that can grant people access to information regarding the government's use of AI. 95 https://www.iso.org/standard/81230.html 47 ● Deliberative process towards AI regulation: Start a regulatory agenda and discussion to assess how to regulate AI, analysing how existing trends (e.g., risk-based approach, sectoral regulation, self-regulation, etc.) fit Cambodia’s reality to design a specific framework for the country.

          "text": " Establishing a national data-sharing framework is key to ensuring a secure and transparent system for cross-sector data sharing, backed by initiatives aimed at improving data quality, documentation, and accessibility.  Building a collaborative data ecosystem requires partnerships among government, academia, and industry to create sector-specific datasets and standards for data usage. Developing AI Policy and Strategy  Existing legislation and policies should be reviewed and updated to incorporate AI-enabled strategies and to ensure active community involvement in the policymaking process. Balancing regulation and innovation is key to fostering a thriving AI ecosystem. Policies should prioritize responsible AI development while establishing safeguards to mitigate potential risks such as bias, misuse, and security breaches.  Due to the rapid pace of AI advancements, AI-related regulations must undergo regular reviews and updates. This dynamic approach will enable Malaysia to adapt to emerging challenges and technological developments, ensuring that the AI governance framework remains relevant and effective.  A Shariah-compliant AI oversight body should be established to manage AI governance from an Islamic perspective. This body will ensure compliance with Shariah principles while promoting innovation within an ethical framework. Inculcating Open Science and Data Sharing within Government and Companies  To inculcate open science and data sharing within government and corporate sectors, a multi-faceted approach is essential to address existing challenges and unlock the full potential of data-driven innovation.

          "text": " Fostering a culture that values transparency, ethical data sharing, and public engagement will lay the foundation for a dynamic, data-powered future where collaboration fuels scientific and societal advancements. Operationalizing Responsible AI for Compliance Purposes  A key recommendation is to develop clear guidelines and standards that outline the ethical use of AI technologies. This ensures that all stakeholders understand their responsibilities in maintaining compliance. It also involves establishing data governance frameworks that prioritize data privacy and security, thereby fostering trust among users and regulators.  Organizations should invest in training and awareness programs for employees to cultivate a culture of responsibility toward AI usage. By equipping staff with knowledge on ethical AI practices and compliance requirements, organizations can better mitigate risks related to bias, discrimination, and misuse of AI systems.

It is worthy to note that the exclusion does not apply to dual-use technologies (i.e. those also used outside of the national security context) and that there is no clear definition of national security provided. The exclusions were debated extensively, both during the negotiation phase of the AI Act and by human rights groups.210 The Netherlands’ Stakeholder Team also highlighted caveats and potential weaknesses caused by the exclusions. Stakeholders mentioned the lack of clarity on the scope of national security, the potentially blurry lines between national and public security, and the high-stakes at hand which need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis to meet the requirements of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.211 The stakeholders argued that the Netherlands must clearly delineate how to address the use of AI under the exclusions of the AI Act and take a leadership position on the topic of human rights. Government response The Dutch government acknowledges the exception in the European AI Act for among others national security, military or defence purposes. However, the Dutch government emphasises the need for the responsible and lawful use of AI. 210 Refer to the joint analysis of leading digital, human rights and social justice groups entitled EU’s AI Act fails to set gold standard for human rights (2024).

A central topic of discussion within the GGE LAWS is the application of international law, particularly international humanitarian law. The Netherlands often emphasizes the significance of international human rights law as a relevant legal framework for the potential development, deployment and use of weapon systems with autonomous capabilities and advocates for the inclusion of this topic in international discussions. Notably, the human rights legal framework imposes more stringent requirements on the use of deadly force in law enforcement contexts compared to the provisions of international humanitarian law governing combat operations.

          "text": "Without mechanisms to make these processes more inclusive and accessible, such as public consultations, educational campaigns, or citizen assemblies on AI, there is a risk that AI policies will not adequately reflect the diverse concerns, values, and needs of Dutch society. This issue becomes of particular relevance in the case of AI being used for algorithmic-decision making.224 In response, the Stakeholder Team advised to formally integrate civic engagement programs and initiatives in the policy-making process around AI. Government response The Dutch government acknowledges the need to encourage social dialogue and cooperation at various levels in order to be able to respond to the fundamental challenges that AI poses. Ensuring safe and responsible development, use, and integration of AI, as well as maximizing the opportunities that AI offers, requires a coordinated effort from all levels of government, the private sector, technical community, academia and civil society. Together with local governments and implementation organizations, the Netherlands is exploring ways in which AI can support in making communication with citizens clearer and more inclusive. The vision on generative AI has been developed in close collaboration with all levels of government (including organisations responsible for implementing policies), businesses from several domains and sectors, academia and civil society. This cooperation remains essential in the future as well. This means actively involving several actors such as civilians, policy-makers from all levels of government, employers, businesses, entrepreneurs, scientists, employees and educators. It is essential that various actors have a voice in shaping the future where generative AI plays a role. The Dutch AI Coalition played a crucial role in fostering social dialogue, for example through the AI-Parade. This was an initiative where 35 libraries were visited across the Netherlands, where citizens could engage in debates, workshop",

One basis to do so, would be to leverage and build on the government wide vision on generative AI (2024) where measures to reduce negative environmental impacts are advocated for.

The sentiment is shared that data centres are located strategically next to green energy wind parks to present users and investors with a sustainable and responsible image, even though these companies might be profiting unfairly from subsidised energy. This could lead to new inequalities as municipalities do not benefit from the green energy that is generated there locally.249 In response to these developments and trends, the Stakeholder Team recommended to commit a greater amount of resources into computing power, both in terms of data centres and high-performance computers. Government response A government that wants to be in control should be a government that, within the existing legal frameworks, can experiment with safe and responsible (generative) AI to help academia, the private sector and public organisations discover where risks and opportunities lie in specific applications.

Without targeted policies to improve digital literacy and ensure equitable access to AI technologies, these communities risk being left further behind in a rapidly evolving digital economy. Addressing this gap is essential for ensuring that AI benefits are distributed inclusively, empowering all sectors of society and creating a stronger societal support base for the digital economy. The Netherlands’ Stakeholder Team flagged that digital literacy in the context of marginalized communities remains a policy area for improvement.259 In response, the stakeholders recommended to develop capacities to design policy that addresses digital literacy throughout all layers of society. To do so, civic engagement and the participation of civil society in policy making was proposed as valuable method to follow. 250 Kabinet presenteert visie op generatieve AI | Nieuwsbericht | Rijksoverheid.nl 251 Regeerprogramma (overheid.nl), page 122. 252 Commission launches AI innovation package (europa.eu) 253 EU competitiveness: Looking ahead - European Commission (europa.eu) 254 e6cd4328-673c-4e7a-8683-f63ffb2cf648_en (europa.eu) 255 Motie van het lid Kathmann (16/01/2025). 256 Kamerbrief verkenning mogelijkheden AI-faciliteit | Kamerstuk | Rijksoverheid.nl; Motie van het lid Kathmann (16/01/2025); Motie van het lid Vermeer (16/01/2025). 257 This was particularly recognized in the context of generative AI (Hendawy, 2024). 258 Gonzales, S.

          "text": "Technological developments, such as the development of generative AI, increase the production and dissemination of disinformation. Distinguishing between reliable, objective and factual news and disinformation is becoming increasingly confusing. In addition, AI technology can facilitate microtargeting, posing risks both to privacy and personal autonomy. This necessitates further efforts to increase media literacy among various target groups in order to prevent less digitally adept people from falling behind as well as protecting them from potentially negative effects of AI. In the Netherlands, the Dutch Network on Media Literacy helps foster media literacy among Dutch society, focussing on both resilience against risks and the opportunities AI offers. In the entire educational system, skills such as critical and structured thinking are becoming increasingly necessary. In this context, the reform of the curriculum for primary and secondary education is important. The new core educational objective on digital literacy as recently launched for primary and secondary education, considers four domains: 1) practical ICT skills, 2) media literacy, 3) digital information skills, 4) computational thinking. Students will acquire knowledge about digital technology, learn how to collaborate with them in a critical and (self)conscious manner, and assess the opportunities and risks involved in using them, which is all very relevant for AI. The AI Act lists a number of factors that weigh in when promoting AI literacy, but these need further fleshing out to provide sufficient guidance. In the context, the Dutch privacy authority has published a short guide to promote AI literacy within organizations that develop AI-systems.260 The Dutch government has an active policy to address disinformation and fake news, taking into account new possibilities based on AI. In its letter of 17 June 2024 it has reported its progress to Dutch parliament.261 Promoting media literacy of Dutch citizens ",

Standards play an important role in this. Supervisors have a role to support companies, large and small, preventively, and proactively in the practical application of the complex legal rules and thus contribute to limiting the high regulatory burden”.263 It is worthwhile to note that the European Union has taken action on this. Notably, by setting up procurement grants to develop “harmonised frameworks, tools and infrastructure at European level to support compliance with the AI Act that have been tested in practice by under-resourced SMEs and public authorities”.264 The Netherlands can play an important role here and one suggested approach is to assess how rules and regulations interplay",

The Dutch government has called upon the European Commission to strictly enforce the evaluation clauses of the legislation under the digital rulebook.265 Additionally, the Dutch government has spoken out in favour of a review of the entire digital rulebook as a whole when all laws have been implemented. Through such a review, the effectiveness and interplay of the legislation can be mapped and improved. The Dutch government is working on establishing regulatory sandboxes for the AI Act. In 2024, a pilot was conducted to gather information on the practical aspects of operating a sandbox and to receive input from stakeholders. An important aspect of the AI Act sandbox is ‘regulatory learning’. According to this principle, the insights and learned lessons from regulatory sandboxes on the application of the AI Act should be shared broadly within the AI-ecosystem and with policy makers. An important point of attention for the Dutch government in the further implementation is how regulatory sandboxes can contribute to harmonised application of the AI Act.",

Additionally, individuals should be able to challenge and appeal automated outcomes that significantly affect them, especially when they affect critical areas such as public services, credit, employment, or education.

This framework should outline clear criteria for assessing AI risks to fundamental rights, safety, fairness, and transparency, and offer practical tools for both public and private sector developers to evaluate their systems throughout the AI lifecycle. The framework should initially focus on high-impact or high-risk use cases, such as AI systems used in healthcare, law enforcement, finance, education, and critical public services—where errors, bias, or lack of oversight could result in significant harm to individuals or society. For high-risk AI systems, policymakers should also consider requiring insurance or liability coverage schemes to ensure adequate compensation in cases of harm, especially when legal responsibility cannot be clearly assigned. While the framework should not impose unnecessary regulatory burdens on low-risk innovation, it should strongly encourage risk-based self-assessment, documentation, and transparency practices for any AI system that affects human decision-making or public trust. The framework can be integrated into existing regulatory sandboxes, procurement processes, or audit mechanisms to ensure responsible AI deployment. Timeline: 2025-2026 Priority: High",

However, the committee’s considerations focus only on technical feasibility and financial efficiency, while neglecting the ethical implications and potential impacts of AI on human rights. Additionally, there are currently no guidelines in Thailand for evaluating human rights risks during AI procurement, leading to an increase in the deployment of opaque systems in public services. 68 142 “Me-Handbook,” accessed April 29, 2025, http://web.undp.org/evaluation/documents/handbook/me-handbook.pdf. 143 “Demystifying the M&E Framework: A Guide for Effective Evaluation,” EvalCommunity (blog), accessed April 29, 2025, https://www.evalcommunity.com/career-center/me-framework/. 144 “Introduction to Monitoring and Evaluation: The Basics,” EvalCommunity (blog), https://www.evalcommunity.com/career-center/monitoring-and-evaluation-basics/. In comparison to international practices, such as the United Kingdom, having AI procurement guidelines is essential for public agencies. This guideline could assist agencies in evaluating their AI needs by providing clear instructions and recommendations for acquiring AI systems. It can also emphasize the importance of ethical considerations in the procurement process aligning with UNESCO’s Ethical Impact Assessment, ensuring a responsible evaluation of suppliers and the adoption of AI technologies that serve the public’s best interests.

Even though the National AI Strategy’s annual report provides a broad overview of each strategy achievement. It does not specify more details about the plan’s evaluations, limitations, or challenges in the implementation phase. As a result, the annual report does not serve as an effective measure for assessing the plan’s implementation. To effectively assess the implementation of the plan, adopting a Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) mechanism is essential. M&E is a systematic process that enables organizations to measure the performance, effectiveness, and impact of programs, projects, or policies. Monitoring ensures activities align with objectives, identifying inefficiencies and delays, while evaluation provides deeper analysis of relevance, efficiency, and outcomes to determine whether goals have been achieved.142 A robust M&E framework typically includes key performance indicators (KPIs), data collection methods, reporting structures, and feedback loops, supporting informed decision-making and continuous improvement.143 It enhances transparency, accountability, and strategic planning, ensuring initiatives remain effective and aligned with their intended purpose.144 Thailand should establish an M&E mechanism to assess the effectiveness of the National AI Strategy, ensuring that its implementation is data-driven and results-oriented. This would provide a structured approach to evaluating real performance, optimizing resources, and maintaining efficiency and accountability. The National AI Committee could serve as the primary agency responsible for M&E, overseeing execution and driving the strategy forward while ensuring its alignment with national objectives.

          "text": "Summary: Tanzania's Human-Centred Path to AI Readiness Tanzania stands at a transformative moment in its technological journey—one that presents both profound challenges and extraordinary opportunities. The stakeholder consultations revealed a vision of technological advancement that transcends binary perspectives of either uncritical adoption or wholesale rejection. Instead, participants articulated a thoughtful path forward that honors Tanzania's cultural heritage while engaging with global technological developments in ways that center human flourishing. This balanced approach recognizes that the most powerful AI solutions will emerge from the creative tension between universal technological capabilities and contextual human wisdom. It acknowledges that technological advancement is never culturally neutral—that meaningful innovation must be rooted in local contexts, values, and aspirations while leveraging global knowledge. The insights from over 240 stakeholders across Dar es Salaam, Dodoma, and Zanzibar reflect a sophisticated understanding that AI development is fundamentally about expanding human capabilities rather than replacing them. Participants consistently emphasized the importance of education, ethical frameworks, cultural preservation, and inclusive participation—demonstrating an intuitive understanding that technology must serve human purposes rather than subordinating human experience to technological imperatives. As Tanzania develops its AI readiness through policy frameworks, institutional capacity, and human capital development, this human-centered perspective offers a compelling alternative to techno-deterministic approaches that dominate much global discourse. By placing cultural context, ethical considerations, and human experience at the center of technological development, Tanzania has the opportunity to create AI systems that enhance rather than diminish human agency—systems that amplify human creativity, strengthen cultural identity, and a",

The country’s strategic policy recommendations and supporting actions encompass crucial aspects such as regulation, creation of an enabling institutional and organisational framework, and capacity building initiatives, all directed at addressing the multifaceted challenges and opportunities presented by the burgeoning use and rapid spread of AI technology. The regulatory framework outlined emphasises the development of policies that prioritise ethical and responsible data systems and processing. Some of the existing Acts, such as POPIA and PEPUDA, uphold and emphasise rights-based protections and ethical AI practices, along with establishing cybersecurity standards and legal safeguards for high-risk AI applications. This reflects an intentional and holistic approach to governance of AI use and application. Additionally, the creation of oversight and implementation mechanisms ensures a robust regulatory environment, fostering trust and accountability in the AI ecosystem. The existence of a functional policy and institutional framework underscores the importance of an independent regulator for AI or the assignment of AI officers within existing institutions, such as the Information Regulator. This collaborative approach across regulators, institutions, and organs aims to enhance the overall effectiveness of responsible AI practices. The emphasis on capacity building, including measures to enable and safeguard AI use in the public sector, highlights a commitment to developing expertise and fostering responsible AI practices at every level.

However, the National Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Policy (Government of Bangladesh, 2018b) references social equity and universal access (Chapter 2, ‘Visions and objectives’, Section 2.2.3). One notable initiative towards gender equity is the Her Power project, or (women’s empowerment through technology) initiated by the ICT Division.23 This project offers women-focused training in ICT fields, including e-commerce, information technology (IT) services, web development and graphic design. Existing wage disparities in the ICT sector, including in entry-level roles such as data entry, highlight the need for policy interventions to promote equal pay and facilitate the upskilling of women, enabling them to transition into higher-value technological roles (Hossain, 2018). While broader education policies, such as the National Education Policy (Government of Bangladesh, 2010), encourage increased female participation in education, they do not specifically address the digital gender divide. Bangladesh does not have targeted policies to address rural-urban disparities; however, general references to socio-economic disparities in this context exist in various policy documents. The draft National AI Policy (Government of Bangladesh, 2024) and the Smart Bangladesh: ICT Master Plan 2041 (Government of Bangladesh, 2023b) acknowledge these inequalities.

          "text": "13 While Bangladesh has benefited from previous digitalization initiatives, which proved particularly valuable during the COVID-19 pandemic (a2i, 2023), the pandemic also exposed a significant digital divide. For example, limited access to devices in urban slum areas hindered residents’ ability to receive essential digital services, including mobile financial aid (Siddiquee et al., 2022). By contrast, rural communities demonstrated resilience by relying on resource-sharing arrangements to overcome similar challenges.26 The lack of continuous, and reliable electricity poses a significant challenge, too. While almost 100 per cent of Bangladesh’s population has access to electricity,27 power cuts are an issue (Varadhan and Chew, 2023), especially in rural areas, where daily interruptions can extend to seven or eight hours. These disparities are even more pronounced in geographically and administratively complex regions, such as the Chittagong Hill Tracts, where transportation difficulties and dual administrative systems often result in confusion regarding service delivery channels. Although previous digitalization initiatives, such as those rolled out under the Bangladesh Vision 2021 programme (Centre for Policy Dialogue, 2007), improved connectivity and literacy, gender, occupational and regional disparities persisted. For instance, garment workers, despite having smartphones, faced language barriers and lacked the time and resources to engage meaningfully with digital technologies.28 Similarly, communities in marginalized regions, including tea gardens, had limited internet access, leaving them disconnected from broader digital advancements.29 There are additional challenges associated with disparities in the cost of communication between urban and rural areas, where marginalized populations often incur higher expenses (Hasan, 2025). A collaborative approach between the government and mobile service providers, building on the regulatory framework established by the B",

Currently, Bangladesh does not have dedicated policies to promote diversity within the digital workforce, and there are no requirements mandating government contractors, academia or technology firms to publicly disclose diversity statistics. Language inclusion is also a key consideration in AI development and innovation. The scarcity of diversified datasets impedes effective AI system training in local languages. Despite access to advanced tools like ChatGPT, output in Bengali remains suboptimal due to the limited availability of open-source datasets. Data translation from English to Bengali often results in poor outcomes, negatively impacting model performance. The Enhancement of Bangla Language in ICT through Research & Development (EBLICT) project,30 under the Bangladesh Computer Council31 and the ICT Division, is a notable initiative meant to address this gap. It has been working on several projects to increase the inclusion of Bengali in the AI landscape, and has developed solutions, such as a sentiment analyser,32 an optical character recognizer,33 a spell checker,34 a speech-to-text and a text-to-speech generator,35 etc. These solutions are availabl",

Bangladesh ranked 8th of 100 countries in ‘trust in government websites and apps’ as per the Economist Impact’s Inclusive Internet Index 2022, with a score of 72 per cent.42 It is noteworthy, however, that this score may not fully reflect recent political developments in Bangladesh nor the perspectives gathered during stakeholder consultations, which indicated a degree of eroded trust in the previous administration. As an example, the e-Nothi system is Bangladesh’s one-stop electronic filing platform designed to streamline government operations, promote paperless offices, and ensure faster, more transparent and accountable public service delivery for its 160 million citizens (Yesmin, 2020). It contains a vast repository of government information, and AI could be used to generate summaries from it. Environmental and sustainability policies The draft National AI Policy 2024 identifies the environment as a priority sector for AI application. Specifically, Section 4.4 (‘Environment, energy, and climate change’) underscores the potential role of AI in optimizing renewable energy production, enhancing weather forecasting capabilities and improving water resource management (Government of Bangladesh, 2024). While the draft policy provides a comprehensive overview of AI applications in environmental conservation, it places comparatively less emphasis on the environmental impact of and sustainability considerations around AI technologies themselves.

Education Integration of digital tools and AI in education Bangladesh’s National Information and Communication Technology Policy aims to integrate digital tools in education by providing multimedia classrooms (Government of Bangladesh, 2018b). However, implementing this vision across over 100,000 primary schools and 33,000 secondary schools poses significant logistical challenges. Despite these hurdles, the concept of blended education has gained momentum, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, and a framework is now in place to support its development. The previous government introduced several platforms or applications aimed at enhancing educational access and efficiency. These include: • \u0007Teachers’ Portal ( )49 is an online platform for teachers designed to create and retrieve digital educational content for different subjects for classroom teaching. • \u0007Dikkha ( ) is an initiative that integrates digital and multimedia classroom solutions, establishing an effective network that connects teachers and students across the country. • \u0007Noipunno ( )50 is another data framework designed to support teachers and students; however, it is not operational currently. • \u0007Kishor Batayon ( )51 helps students manage their classes and coursework. The ICT Division’s Hour of Code programme encourages school students to dedicate one hour each day to learning coding skills,52 while UNICEF and the Directorate of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education have developed gamified learning content, currently being piloted in twenty-four schools.53 AI integration into the country’s education system remains in its early stages, with significant potential for expansion.

The secondary education curriculum introduces a course on ICT at every level from Grade 6 to Grade 12 (National Curriculum and Textbook Board, 2012: Section 5.2).

Besides these institutionalized courses, the Digital Security Agency of the ICT Division offers a course on cybersecurity and usage of digital tools for secondary and higher secondary students. When it comes to higher education, there is a gap between the technical and ethical aspects of AI education. Existing ICT and AI curricula are predominantly oriented towards technical competencies, such as coding and machine learning, with limited emphasis on critical ethical considerations, including privacy protection, bias mitigation and algorithmic fairness. Furthermore, soft skills relevant to ethical AI practices – such as responsible data use – are not yet systematically integrated into educational frameworks, though they are essential for fostering responsible AI development and deployment. While AI, including its ethical dimensions, is largely absent from primary and secondary education curricula, notable progress has been made at the tertiary level. Universities have begun incorporating foundational AI tools into curricula across disciplines. Alongside, teacher-training programmes for secondary and higher secondary educators employ blended learning models that create opportunities for future AI integration. Nevertheless, a stronger focus on embedding the ethical aspects of AI in curricula, alongside efforts to bridge existing gaps in",

The State List includes matters where states exercise exclusive \nauthority, such as police, public health, law and order, and education. The Concurrent List allows both \nthe centre and the states to legislate on subjects such as criminal law and insolvency, with central law \nprevailing in case of conflict. This federal design ensures that policy-making reflects India’s diversity: \nstates have both the power and the obligation to adapt national frameworks to local conditions, \nmaking governance inherently contextual and negotiated. \nParliament \nThe Indian Parliament remains central to the lawmaking process, with the power to debate and pass \nbills introduced by the executive.

Moreover, given Laos currently has only two operational data centers, co-locating new ones along energy corridors presents a cost-effective opportunity. To address this, the government can embed universal service and broadband connectivity obligations into major infrastructure projects, particularly in sectors like energy, telecommunications, and mining. These obligations should be supported by regulatory and financial incentives to make rural expansion viable for private investors. It is important to note that many industry representatives were unfamiliar with government-led infrastructure and R&D incentive mechanisms.

Its core responsibilities would include overseeing the implementation of the national AI strategy, harmonizing AI-related regulations, fostering multi-sector collaboration, and ensuring compliance with ethical standards. The government can build on the existing National Committee for Digital Transformation, which already brings 59 together ministries and agencies with structural representation on digital and computing matters, by extending its mandate to coordinate AI-related affairs. This would allow AI governance to be embedded into an established national coordination mechanism, avoiding duplication and ensuring alignment with broader digital transformation priorities.",

To ensure these centers thrive within the existing top-down, grant driven nature research culture where researchers typically seek funding before developing research topics, it is crucial to actively engage donors and align their funding priorities with the goal of fostering collaboration, like pushing them to start cross- disciplinary AI research centers within universities. Encouraging donors to support cross-disciplinary initiatives can help shift incentives away from fragmented agendas toward more integrated and strategic research efforts.

A good starting point is innovation (whether in adoption or creation of local solutions) and the preparedness to tackle the risks it poses – not the least of which is contextual adaptability in a sector that is heavily designed for maximising social human interactions. 29 Action 2a: Discuss policies and/or regulations as part of an updated national AI strategy. Time frame for this is estimated to be 3 months with the process to be driven by MITCI. Action 2b: Review sector-based progress of the existing strategy and propose corrective measures based on recent learnings.

Inadequate, poor quality, and biased data are well-known challenges in building ethical AI systems. This issue is global but is compounded by peculiar factors in Mauritius. For example, while a significant number of datasets are available as part of the open dataset repository managed by the MDPA, the breadth of data available, usually government-based data, could be viewed as limited for purposes of advanced analytics. Hence, there is a need to augment or supplement with data from other sources, but data merging between different dataset technologies is a recurrent challenge that can inhibit creation of beneficial datasets. Furthermore, many organisations either do not have enough data or have data that is not available in machine-readable formats. Although e-government initiatives have begun, many private and public institutions have historically relied on paper-based data. Thus, for applications requiring long series data, converting paper-based data to digital formats will require substantial efforts and resources. Action 9: Improve capability to capture and generate datasets whilst promoting data engineering and improving data scientists’ skill sets. To be conducted by MDPA in collaboration with academic institutions. Timeframe is 1 year. 34 The table ",

The latter, operating under the Presidency of Uruguay, is overseeing the review of the AI Strategy and the development of the first National Data Strategy, receiving technical support from CAF and UNESCO for both initiatives. The initiative is driven by significant international changes in principles and standards, technological developments such as generative AI, and the alignment of the current Artificial Intelligence Strategy for Digital Government, effective since 2020, among other factors. In this consultation and participation process, efforts focused on aspects of institutionalization and governance of the new AI strategy, allowing room to define the alternative that best suits the country (AGESIC, 2023d). The Uruguayan State’s prior experience with AGESIC shows the possibilities within the existing framework to innovate and make institutional adjustments in line with ethical recommendations (AGESIC, 2020a). Furthermore, an article has been included in the Accountability Bill (Ley de Rendición de Cuentas, October 2023) (Law 20.212, 2023) that has assigned to AGESIC the responsibility for designing and developing AI and Data Strategies, while also advocating for the corresponding regulation.

This journey began with the following key milestones: • Resolution No. 52-NQ/TW issued by the Politburo in 2019, on guidelines and policies to proactively participate in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. This Resolution identifies AI as one of six priority technology groups. The State will provide support mainly through institutional innovation and improvement, the creation of a favourable business environment, investment in infrastructure, human resource development, science and technology development, and public procurement. • On the basis of Resolution No. 52-NQ/TW, the Prime Minister successively issued Decision No. 2289/QD-TTg dated 31 December 2020 (promulgating the National Strategy on the Fourth Industrial Revolution to 2030) and Decision No. 127/QD-TTg dated 26 January 2021 (promulgating the National Strategy on Research, Development, and Application of Artificial Intelligence to 2030). • Decision No. 127/QD-TTg sets the goal that by 2030 Viet Nam will become a centre of innovation and the development of strong AI application solutions. This Decision assigns responsibilities to 15 ministries, one ministerial-level agency, and one government agency, with the MST serving as the focal point to lead the organization, implementation, and consolidation of the Strategy’s implementation progress. In addition to Decision No. 127/QD-TTg on the overarching Strategy, policies on building digital data and digital human resources to serve AI development have also been addressed in a series of other policy decisions, such as Decision No. 749/QD-TTg of the Prime Minister dated 3 June 2020 approving the “National Digital Transformation Programme to 2025, with O",
