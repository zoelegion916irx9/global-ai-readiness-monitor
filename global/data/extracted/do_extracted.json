The world is now set to change at a pace not seen in decades, \neven centuries. AI-based tools and applications make our lives easier, smoother, and more prosperous. They help us move efficiently, \nget informed, get credit, get a job, and get our taxes done.\nBut in its current form, AI reproduces and amplifies many social challenges we face. It is unacceptable that around a third of the \nworld’s population still lacks adequate internet access. Upstream, the AI industry is highly concentrated, with just two countries\n– the United States and China – and a dozen companies accounting for a more significant sector share. This can lead only to greater \ninequality of outcomes – including gender disparities – downstream. Non-diverse AI teams, unrepresentative datasets, and opaque \nand biased algorithms can cause harm, particularly to those already vulnerable, whether companies or individuals, children and \nyoung people, women, or entire democracies.\nThat is why UNESCO drafted the Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, adopted in 2021 by 193 countries to ensure \nAI delivers fair, sustainable, and inclusive outcomes. The Recommendation is based on the protection and promotion of human \nrights, human dignity, and environmental sustainability, and these values are then translated into principles such as accountability, \ntransparency, and privacy. The Recommendation also sets out concrete policy actions that governments can draw on to steer \ntechnological developments in a responsible direction, premi",

While the proposal includes quantitative measurement indicators, it is also crucial to design a qualitative process, such as the legal dimension of RAM, which could be a new application of RAM in the future, to complement the quantitative indicators. Moreover, it is essential to seek support from international organizations in creating these indicators, as some, like AI adoption rates, have proven to be complex to design and measure. In line with this, it is important to advance the incorporation of the Dominican Republic in international indices and indicators, such as the OECD, the Latin American AI Index, and the Stanford Index, among others. 2. REGULATORY UPDATE 2.1. Regulation of AI. While the ENIA does propose legal and regulatory initiatives in various areas, it lacks a clear impetus to discuss the relevance of a specific AI regulation in the country and/or develop it. In the rapidly evolving AI landscape, it is imperative to initiate a focused discussion that takes into account the national and regional reality, rather than simply importing discussions from entities like the",

PUBLIC SECTOR CAPABILITIES Although some initiatives aim to strengthen the ICT capabilities of public officials, they are still incipient and do not contemplate mandatory nature or certifications. In this line, having an institutional framework with trained personnel is relevant, so training officials and establishing compulsory and constant updating mechanisms should be a priority. This is partially covered in the ENIA, promoting training for officials and an AI Center of Excellence. The design of incentives is a challenge that needs to be addressed so that certification and education instruments are effectively used 4. DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION POLICIES 4.1. Promote a gender diversity agenda in AI. A significant gender gap was identified in STEM and although there is no data, it can be inferred that AI must be the same or worse, which coincides with existing reports 81 Although the ENIA covers the issue of focusing talent policies, this is not enough. The underrepresentation of women in AI, a significant gender gap identified in STEM, is a pressing issue that must be urgently addressed. According to the RAM, there is no gap in performance but instead in graduates and the prospects of entering the STEM field. Along these lines, work must be done on the design of positive discrimination initiatives, dissemination and visibility of female references in AI, and incentives through public purchases for diversity in teams. 4.2. Promote an agenda with a rural focus. The ENIA does not cover the existing infrastructure gap between rural and urban areas. The development of AI and its use in different areas can increase the gap in terms of quality of life if there is no adequate agenda to address it. In line with this, it is recommended to study promoting policies in local governme",

      "text": "Promoting policies in this area has a dual purpose. On the one hand, it is recommended to study the uses of AI for culture and heritage preservation, promote positive adoption, and take advantage of its opportunities for creation and preservation. However, the impact often involving regulatory discussions in areas such as those mentioned above regarding intellectual property and copyright must also be addressed. 30 5.2. Drive an agenda on opportunities and impacts of AI on the environment. While mentioned in the ENIA as a potential area from a mission-driven policy perspective, there is no specific prioritisation towards using AI to mitigate the climate crisis. Furthermore, there is no mention of the potential impacts that AI and its development may have on the environment, and no regulation addresses it. Along these lines, it is recommended to start discussions with multiple stakeholders on the relevance of rules around the impact of AI on the environment and move forward with a prioritised agenda both in this sense and in the use of AI for conservation and preservation. It is relevant that the discussion be in-depth and anchored in the local reality. This is because incorrect regulations can curb potential positive uses of AI. For example, the environmental impact assessment generates an extra burden on researchers and entrepreneurs and would only be justified if, in fact, models were being developed in the Dominican Republic, whose high energy consumption could harm the environment. Otherwise, it could be overregulated and end up harming development. 6. DATA COLLECTION 6.1. Collect data on research, development, innovation and entrepreneurship (R+D+i+e).",
