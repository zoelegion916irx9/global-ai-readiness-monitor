      "text": "country and internationally with partner governments. An assessment should be undertaken as to whether current data protection frameworks and regulations are adequately reflecting the challenges posed by AI systems. Institutional Framework 1.Establish a National AI Council with multi-stakeholder representation: A National AI Council should be established with representatives from government, academia, private sector, and civil society. This council would provide oversight for national AI initiatives, coordinate activities across sectors, and advise on policy development as well as international engagement and coordination with other African countries on AI policy and government. The multi-stakeholder approach would ensure diverse perspectives are considered in AI governance. This council should serve as a forum for addressing emerging ethical, social, and legal issues related to AI deployment. It should facilitate ongoing dialogue across sectors while providing authoritative guidance on responsible AI development. Its diverse composition should ensure that multiple perspectives— including those of traditionally marginalized groups—are represented in AI governance. 2.Create a National AI Research Centre: Tanzania should establish a National AI Research Centre to drive innovation, conduct locally relevant research, and develop solutions to national challenges. The centre would serve as a hub for collaboration between researchers, industry, and government, focusing on applied research that addresses Tanzania's unique needs. This research centre should prioritize projects that leverage Tanzania's distinctive assets—including linguistic diversity, cultural heritage, and ecological knowledge— while addressing local challenges. It should establish collaboration mechanisms with international research networks while ensuring that research priorities reflect national development goals. The centre should also build strategic partnerships with international AI research networks",

      "text": "Capacity Building and Training 1.Integrate AI literacy into educational curricula at all levels: AI literacy should be integrated into educational curricula from primary to tertiary levels, with age-appropriate content that builds a foundational understanding, technical knowledge, and skills. This would include both technical aspects and ethical considerations, preparing students to participate in an AI-enabled society. This curricular integration should move beyond narrow technical skills to address the broader social, ethical, and cultural dimensions of AI. It should cultivate critical thinking about technology while developing both practical skills and ethical frameworks for responsible participation in technological development. 2.Develop specialised AI degree programs and professional certifications: Universities and technical institutions should develop specialized degree programs and professional certifications in AI-related fields. These programs should be designed in collaboration with industry partners to ensure relevance to market needs, addressing critical skills gaps, while also advancing scientific discovery and knowledge in the field. These educational programs should balance technical depth with interdisciplinary breadth, ensuring that graduates understand both the technical foundations of AI and its broader implications. They should incorporate hands-on projects addressing real-world challenges while developing the ethical reasoning capabilities essential for responsible AI development. For responsible and sustainable AI growth, these programs should also promote ethical awareness, critical thinking and an understanding of AI’s social and economic implications. 3.Create public awareness programs on AI benefits and risks: Public awareness campaigns should be developed to educate citizens about the benefits and potential risks of AI technologies, as well as existing initiatives in the country. These campaigns would build understanding, reduce fear and",

      "text": "Summary: Tanzania's Human-Centred Path to AI Readiness Tanzania stands at a transformative moment in its technological journey—one that presents both profound challenges and extraordinary opportunities. The stakeholder consultations revealed a vision of technological advancement that transcends binary perspectives of either uncritical adoption or wholesale rejection. Instead, participants articulated a thoughtful path forward that honors Tanzania's cultural heritage while engaging with global technological developments in ways that center human flourishing. This balanced approach recognizes that the most powerful AI solutions will emerge from the creative tension between universal technological capabilities and contextual human wisdom. It acknowledges that technological advancement is never culturally neutral—that meaningful innovation must be rooted in local contexts, values, and aspirations while leveraging global knowledge. The insights from over 240 stakeholders across Dar es Salaam, Dodoma, and Zanzibar reflect a sophisticated understanding that AI development is fundamentally about expanding human capabilities rather than replacing them. Participants consistently emphasized the importance of education, ethical frameworks, cultural preservation, and inclusive participation—demonstrating an intuitive understanding that technology must serve human purposes rather than subordinating human experience to technological imperatives. As Tanzania develops its AI readiness through policy frameworks, institutional capacity, and human capital development, this human-centered perspective offers a compelling alternative to techno-deterministic approaches that dominate much global discourse. By placing cultural context, ethical considerations, and human experience at the center of technological development, Tanzania has the opportunity to create AI systems that enhance rather than diminish human agency—systems that amplify human creativity, strengthen cultural identity, and a",
