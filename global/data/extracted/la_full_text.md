FOREWORD
We have officially entered the Age of Artificial Intelligence. 
The world is now set to change at a pace not seen in 
decades, even centuries. AI-based tools and applications 
make our lives easier, smoother, and richer. They help us 
move efficiently, get informed, get credit, get a job, and get 
our taxes done.
But in its current form, AI reproduces and amplifies many 
of the social challenges we face. It is not acceptable that 
around a third of the world’s population still lacks adequate 
internet access. Upstream, the AI industry is highly 
concentrated, with just two countries, the United States 
and China, and a dozen companies accounting for a major 
share of the sector. This can lead only to greater inequality 
of outcomes, including gender disparities downstream. 
Non-diverse AI teams, unrepresentative datasets, and opaque and biased algorithms can cause harm, particularly to those 
who are already vulnerable, whether companies or individuals, children and young people, women, or entire democracies.
That is why UNESCO drafted the Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, which was adopted in 2021 by 193 
countries to make sure AI delivers fair, sustainable, and inclusive outcomes. The Recommendation is based on the protection 
and promotion of human rights, human dignity, and environmental sustainability, and these values are then translated into 
principles such as accountability, transparency, and privacy. The Recommendation also sets out concrete policy actions 
that governments can draw on to steer technological development in a responsible direction, premised on the belief that 
light-touch regulation, which has until now remained the norm, is insufficient. We need capable governments that are well 
equipped, in terms of competencies, institutions and laws, to frame responsible AI development and protect the rule of law 
online, and public and private developers who are accountable for putting human rights and fundamental freedoms – not 
profits or geopolitical considerations – first. 
The Readiness Assessment Methodology (RAM) is a diagnostic tool intended to assist Member States in upholding their 
commitment to the Recommendation by helping them understand how prepared they are to implement AI ethically and 
responsibly for all their citizens. By highlighting any institutional, regulatory, or data gaps and obstacles, it enables UNESCO 
to tailor support for governments to fill those gaps to ensure an ethical AI ecosystem aligned with the Recommendation.
Lao PDR is building strong momentum in its digital transformation journey, opening a timely and promising opportunity to 
harness artificial intelligence in ways that advance national development ethically and inclusively. With its youthful population, 
the country holds great potential to cultivate a new generation of innovators, developers, and problem-solvers who can 
shape AI solutions for local needs. While AI governance is still at an early stage, this is an ideal moment to integrate ethics 
and policy considerations from the very beginning. We look forward to supporting Lao PDR in this process and thank the 
Government for inviting UNESCO to contribute to this important endeavor.

### Page 13

11
Our assessment found that Lao PDR is accelerating its digital transformation through productive collaboration with 
international institutions and the rollout of forward-looking strategies and action plans. These steps are creating the 
foundations for the responsible adoption of AI technologies. The recognition of AI in legislation, along with existing 
laws on data protection, cybercrime, and IT enterprises, demonstrates an awareness of both the opportunities and the 
responsibilities that come with emerging technologies. Building AI-specific mechanisms to address potential misuse and 
ensure accountability will further strengthen this framework.
Opportunities abound. Expanding online content and digital cultural assets in the Lao language can boost inclusivity 
and ensure AI reflects the country’s heritage and diversity. Bridging rural-urban digital capacity gaps can unlock broader 
participation, while Laos’ youthful population offers an engine for rapid skills development if supported by strong educational 
pathways, funding, and academic collaboration.
The private sector is already leading AI implementation through practical use cases, and further investment can accelerate 
this growth. Empowering local developers with opportunities to work on relevant applications will boost fluency and 
reduce reliance on external actors. Strategic infrastructure investments in areas such as internet coverage, next-generation 
connectivity, and data centers, can be driven through public–private partnerships, with incentives and grants encouraging 
private sector participation. Laos’ abundant hydropower resources, for example, could be leveraged to develop sustainable 
data centers that serve both domestic and regional needs.
National stakeholders express genuine enthusiasm for advancing AI, with a focus on building fundamental capacity that 
aligns with the country’s development priorities. Their vision is to ensure that AI growth complements, rather than competes 
with, investments in essential infrastructure and basic services, paving the way for a future where technology serves the 
needs and aspirations of all Lao people.
Overall, this report presents a fundamentally optimistic vision that we at UNESCO share: that ethical governance and 
responsible regulation of AI is entirely consistent with innovation and economic growth and is essential for ensuring a 
technological ecosystem that benefits the public good. With the RAM data and this report, Laos has a clear roadmap for 
how to get there.
It was a pleasure working with the Government of Laos to conduct this exercise. We are grateful for their engagement with 
the RAM and I am sure that by following the path laid out in this report, Laos will be able to reap the benefits of AI while 
making sure that AI technologies deliver fair, sustainable, and inclusive outcomes.

FOREWORD
The Ministry of Technology and Communications of the 
Lao People’s Democratic Republic is honored to present 
the nation’s first Artificial Intelligence Readiness Assessment 
Report, developed with the support of the United 
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 
(UNESCO), and in close collaboration with other national 
and international partners. This assessment represents a 
significant milestone in our country’s journey toward the 
responsible, inclusive, and transformative adoption of 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies.
In today’s rapidly advancing digital era, AI is reshaping 
societies, economies, and governance systems across 
the globe. For the Lao PDR, AI holds immense promise to 
enhance productivity, modernize public services, address 
critical social challenges, and promote sustainable and inclusive growth. At the same time, it demands that we uphold the 
highest standards of ethics, equity, and safety. The undertaking of this AI Readiness Assessment reflects our commitment 
to adhere to the UNESCO 2021 Recommendation of the Ethics of AI, the only globally agreed normative instrument to date 
that places ethics at the center of AI development.
This assessment is grounded in the 2021 UNESCO Recommendation and its AI Readiness Assessment Methodology (RAM), 
offering a comprehensive analysis of AI readiness across key dimensions such as legal and regulatory frameworks, sociocultural 
aspects, scientific and educational perspectives, as well as economic and technological angles. It is the product of extensive 
consultations with government institutions, academic experts, private-sector representatives, the United Nations Country 
Team, and civil society stakeholders throughout the country.
The importance of this report cannot be overstated. By providing a detailed analysis of both opportunities and challenges, 
it equips policymakers, industry leaders, researchers, and the population with the knowledge and insights needed to define 
the purposes of AI for Lao society, design strategies, policies, and initiatives that will maximize the benefits of AI for our people. 
It highlights priority areas for action, including capacity building and talent development, investment in scientific research 
and innovation, laws and regulation revision, as well as respect for cultural and linguistic diversity. Furthermore, it identifies 
promising initiatives already underway, such as advancements in smart agriculture, e-government, and AI applications for the 
Lao language, which demonstrate our potential to become an active player and champion of an ethical and inclusive use of AI.
The Ministry wishes to express its deep appreciation to the UNESCO experts for their technical guidance and expertise 
throughout this process, which greatly enhanced the quality and rigor of the assessment. We also acknowledge the valuable 
contributions of the technical team of the Ministry of Technology and Communications and the support of all related 
organizations, whose dedication and collaboration ensured that this report is both comprehensive and informative. Their 
collective efforts have resulted in a document that will serve as a cornerstone for future AI policy and strategic development 
in the Lao PDR.

### Page 15

As we move forward, this report will serve as a reference for the formulation of the National AI Strategy and as a foundation 
for policymaking on emerging technologies. The Ministry of Technology and Communications reaffirms its commitment 
to ensuring that AI in Laos is developed and applied in ways that are ethical, inclusive, and aligned with our national values, 
international standards, and long-term development aspirations.
Together, let us shape an AI future that leaves no one behind.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Laos is making deliberate strides toward digital transformation as part of its long-term economic development strategy. 
Recognizing the transformative potential of digital technologies, the Lao government, working in collaboration with 
international development partners and the private sector, is expanding national digital infrastructure and capabilities. 
With the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), this potential can be further amplified. However, to reach this stage, cross-sector 
and multidisciplinary collaboration is essential, partnerships and investments must be synergized, and the government must 
make the crucial leap, from planning to concrete execution.
DIAGNOSIS OF KEY ASPECTS
Below are some key points to note in the country’s progress to responsibly adopt AI technologies:
	•
In the legal context, Lao PDR’s regulatory framework for AI is still nascent. While the government is drafting a National 
AI Strategy, there are currently no laws addressing core AI issues such as transparency, accountability, or algorithmic 
redress. Existing frameworks like the Cybercrime Law, Data Protection Law and the Digital Government Decree cover 
general data and computing use but lack AI-specific provisions. AI is referenced in recent constitutional amendments 
and draft digital transformation policies, but there’s room for improvement in transforming those acknowledgements 
to clear legal mechanisms to protect citizens and bolster innovation.
	•
For the sociocultural domain, despite progress in gender inclusivity, rural communities in Laos still face limited access 
to digital technologies due to infrastructure gaps, affordability, and low digital literacy. Successful collaborations 
with international organizations highlight what’s possible but also stress the need for ongoing investment in local 
capacity, outreach, and trust-building. Digital initiatives in health and efforts addressing concerns about technology’s 
environmental impact are evident, but they have not been specifically focused on AI. Digital transformation must 
also prioritize cultural preservation, including the development of culturally-aware datasets and NLP tools. Currently, 
most Lao language datasets and NLP tools are lagging participation from native Lao researchers, risking linguistic 
sovereignty and underrepresenting local dialects, norms, and values.
	•
AI talent and innovation development in Laos needs strong support from its education and research ecosystems. 
University departments like Computer Science and Software Engineering are small and often siloed, with little cross-
disciplinary collaboration. Research output needs some improvement. Promising developments in AI/ICT curricula 
in K-12 level are welcome, although  their effectiveness must be closely monitored.
	•
Laos’s digital economy remains small, constrained by a large informal sector, limited digital infrastructure, and low 
ICT investment, factors that hinder AI adoption and innovation. While some private companies in sectors such as 
telecom, banking, logistics, and manufacturing are beginning to use AI tools, and urban populations are gradually 
adopting app-based lifestyles, broader progress is limited by lagging human capital pipelines, minimal domestic 
investment, and an underdeveloped startup ecosystem. Foreign-developed platforms still continue to dominate the 
market, which if continued can limit local developers from developing capabilities and use cases. Aside from that, 
most Foreign Development Investment (FDI) remains concentrated in resource extraction, and budget shortfalls 
undermine the sustainability of e-government initiatives.
	•
There is a critical need for a strong commitment to funding both the hard and soft infrastructure that supports AI. 
This includes enhancing cybersecurity capacity, reliable networks, and data centers and ensuring affordable access 
to computing infrastructure for AI practitioners and stakeholders.

MAPPING THE AI ECOSYSTEM
Lao PDR’s AI ecosystem is emerging with enthusiasm but faces substantial barriers across stakeholder groups. While ministries, 
universities, businesses, media, and civil society are experimenting with AI tools, many encounter shared challenges such as 
limited institutional capacity, lack of clear regulatory guidance, and insufficient funding. Fragmentation, often referred to as 
working in silos, was a major concern, with stakeholders acting independently without common platforms for coordination 
or knowledge-sharing. Cross-disciplinary collaboration, in particular, remains awkward and inconsistent, with disconnects 
between technical, policy, and sectoral actors hindering more integrated experimentation and policy responses. 
Despite these challenges, interest in AI remains strong. In one of the assessment surveys being done, it is found that 84% of 
the Lao PDR’s AI RAM survey respondents already use AI tools personally, significantly outpacing formal institutional adoption. 
Universities are beginning to update curricula and offer training, ministries are drafting national strategies and piloting use 
cases, and private sector actors are incorporating AI into business operations such as customer service and fraud detection. 
Youth groups and media organizations are also exploring AI for content creation and journalism.
However, this enthusiasm is still exploratory. Stakeholders consistently emphasized that more structured support is 
needed: including not just technical training but also foundational skills like English language proficiency, alongside clearer 
regulations, improved digital infrastructure, and sustainable funding. These elements are seen as essential for enabling deeper, 
more responsible integration of AI across sectors.
There is a clear mutual expectation among stakeholder groups: government is expected to set strategic direction, develop 
legal frameworks, and provide funding; academia is seen as responsible for building human capital and conducting applied 
research; industry is urged to localize and scale innovations; civil society and media are counted on to promote digital literacy 
and safeguard ethical standards. International organizations are widely recognized as critical partners for capacity-building, 
technical assistance, and long-term sustainability, particularly in helping to contextualize global best practices to local needs 
and avoid overreliance on external technologies.
However, without a coordinating mechanism, these roles risk remaining siloed, and the collective momentum may be diluted. 
Bridging these divides, through multi-stakeholder platforms, joint pilot projects, shared resource pools, and facilitated cross-
disciplinary collaboration, will be essential to turn interest into impact and ambition into action.
RECOMMENDATIONS
Introduce AI Regulation That Covers Gaps and Signifies Global Consensus and Local Values. 
Address the highlighted gap of transparency, accountability, or algorithmic redress in the current law, and specify ethical 
values that the nation expects of its AI development and usage to reference global frameworks but include local wisdom 
in doing so.
Embed Universal Service, Digital Infrastructure Building and Connectivity Obligations into Big Projects and 
Investments 
Bridge the digital divide by embedding broadband and data center development into major infrastructure projects, especially 
in rural areas. Leverage sectors like energy and mining to co-locate digital infrastructure and offer incentives, such as tax 
breaks and extended licenses to private investors committed to universal service delivery.

### Page 18

Incentivize Companies Developing AI Capabilities and Talents 
Similarly with infrastructure, incentivize companies that invest in AI capabilities and workforce upskilling through grants 
and tax relief.
Facilitate public–private Innovation Programmes and Pilot Sandboxes in Key Industries 
Launch public-private innovation programs and sector-specific AI sandboxes in key industries like agriculture and tourism 
to pilot governance mechanisms and responsible AI solutions while promoting public awareness and investment. 
Institutional Frameworks
Establish a National AI Council 
For a cross-cutting technology, multi-sectoral technology like AI, collaboration is essential, and a National AI Council could 
become a trigger point to foster a multisectoral collaborative culture that is still largely lacking
Setup Cross-disciplinary AI Research Centers in Universities 
Simultaneously, create university-based, interdisciplinary AI research centers that connect fields like ethics and computer 
science and serve as drivers of innovation and academic excellence.
Capacity Building Initiatives
Scale AI Literacy and Ethics Education 
Integrate AI literacy and ethics into national education curricula, media programming, and civil service training. Engage all 
parties concerned, representatives in doing this.
Launch a Context-aware AI Talent Inclusion Scholarship
Launch AI scholarships and mentorship schemes targeting rural and underserved communities to build an inclusive talent 
pipeline. 
Invest in Dataset Localisation and Language Resources 
Invest in Lao-language datasets and content resources, encouraging open data access and alignment with student research 
(e.g. creating a national challenge of dataset creation for thesis projects) to expand national capacity.
Clarity of Roles for Subnational Authorities
Empowering Local AI Governance
Support subnational governments, especially cities and provinces, in building the capacity and confidence to pilot AI use 
cases and regulatory sandboxes. Many leading examples of AI governance globally come from the city level. Localizing AI 
strategies allows governments to address context-specific opportunities and risks more effectively.
These efforts should be rolled out in three phases: the Foundation Phase establishes regulations, institutions, and public 
awareness; the Demonstration Phase pilots applications and tests governance tools; and the Institutionalisation Phase scales 
successful models into national frameworks and secures long-term sustainability.

DIAGNOSIS OF THE  
NATIONAL AI LANDSCAPE
OVERVIEW
1	
World Bank: Lao PDR Total Population
Laos, a landlocked lower-middle-income country in Southeast Asia with 7.6 million people1, is pursuing digital transformation as 
part of its economic development strategy. With a comparatively young and growing population, the country is seeking to harness 
digital technologies for its growth. As part of this initiative, the government is seizing the advent and potential of AI by drafting a 
10-year national AI strategy, guided by UNESCO’s Readiness Assessment Methodology (RAM) under the Recommendation on the 
Ethics of AI.
The RAM serves as both diagnosis and planning, helping Laos assess its digital landscape, identify priority sectors, and embed ethical, 
human-centered principles into its AI agenda. During the process, UNESCO and the government have convened workshops and 
consultations with government, civil society, academia, and industry to build consensus on responsible AI use.
AI offers Laos opportunities to modernize governance, improve productivity, and formalize its informal economy. With its youth 
as a key driver of digital adoption, AI-driven innovation could provide a new engine of growth as the country diversifies beyond 
traditional sectors. The Ministry of Technology and Communications has also framed AI as a national necessity linked to workforce 
readiness, sovereign innovation, and entrepreneurship. 
The Covid-19 pandemic demonstrated Laos’ ability to leapfrog through rapid digital uptake in health, education, and remote work. 
However, to fully realize the benefits of digital transformation, the government must address systemic barriers, including gaps in 
coordination mechanisms, limited regulation, and sharp urban-rural divides in access and literacy. 
Strategic Direction of Digital Transformation and AI Development
Along with international organizations, The Lao Government is currently in the process of advancing digital transformation through 
the creation of a strategic framework built upon three interconnected pillars: Digital Government, Digital Economy, and Digital Society. 
This framework will guide national efforts to harness emerging technologies in support of growth, development, and improved 
governance. They are currently being formalized through the upcoming Decree on Digital Transformation, which is now available 
in public draft form. 
Under the Digital Government pillar, the focus is on modernizing public service delivery, enhancing administrative efficiency, 
and strengthening transparency through the use of digital platforms. By digitizing government functions and data systems, 
Laos aims to create a more accessible, responsive, and citizen-centric public sector.
The Digital Economy pillar targets the transformation of economic structures by fostering innovation, entrepreneurship, and digital 
skills. It supports the growth of sectors such as agriculture, tourism, and commerce by encouraging the adoption of digital 
technologies that improve productivity, enable access to markets, and stimulate job creation. AI is expected to play a critical role 
in optimizing value chains, supporting small businesses, and enhancing labor market efficiency.
Meanwhile, the Digital Society pillar addresses the broader social dimensions of digital transformation, emphasizing equitable 
access to technology, digital literacy, and its responsible use. Special attention is given to expanding access to quality 
education, improving healthcare delivery, and promoting digital inclusion across rural and underserved populations. These 
efforts are central to ensuring that digital and AI advancements benefit all segments of society, including children, youth, 
and vulnerable groups.

The digital transformation momentum is further reinforced by the establishment of the National Digital Transformation 
Committee. Chaired by the Prime Minister, the committee is an interministerial body deputized by the Deputy Prime 
Minister/Minister of Public Security, the Deputy Prime Minister/Minister of Foreign Affairs, and the Minister of Technology 
and Communications. With structural representation from all ministries, the committee is tasked with overseeing the 
implementation of the country’s digital vision, strategies, and transformation plans through a whole-of-government approach.2

In formulating policies around digital technologies, the government has championed a multi-actor approach (see figure 1). 
For their foray into AI, the government is using a similar approach. The Ministry of Technology and Communications holds 
primary responsibility for AI policy, with the Department of Technology and Innovation spearheading efforts to establish 
AI governance mechanisms. The Applied Research Institute of Smart Technology, under the Ministry, collaborates with 
stakeholders, including UNESCO and other global partners to explore ethical and practical pathways for responsible AI 
adoption. Sector-specific ministries, such as the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Education and Sports, are also investigating 
how to regulate and cultivate AI usage in their respective sectors.
Alongside the government’s initiatives, some parts of Lao’s industry have emerged as a dynamic testing ground for 
AI deployment. A growing number of companies across telecommunications, finance, logistics, agriculture, retail, 
and manufacturing are leveraging AI to enhance operations, customer service, fraud detection, predictive maintenance, 
and personalized offerings (see Figure 2 and the section on the economy for more detail). This momentum in commercial 
innovation highlights the increasing relevance of AI across the Lao economy and underscores the need for coordinated 
public sector strategies that can harness these advancements while ensuring ethical, inclusive, and sustainable outcomes.

STRUCTURAL CHALLENGES TO AI INTEGRATION IN LAOS
Despite promising initiatives across the government and the private sector, Laos faces a range of structural challenges that 
must be addressed to fully harness AI as a lever for economic growth and national development. These challenges span 
legal, sociocultural, educational, economic, and technological dimensions and are further compounded by institutional 
fragmentation and capacity gaps. Addressing these issues holistically will be critical to ensuring that AI adoption is effective 
and aligned with national priorities, as well as being responsible and ethical.
Legal and Regulatory Gaps
Although Laos has introduced foundational digitalization laws to enable the broader digital transformation, the legal and 
regulatory environment specific to AI remains nascent. Currently, there are no formal laws or policies that explicitly address 
AI governance, data protection specific to AI systems, algorithmic accountability, or the ethical implications of automated 
decision-making. This regulatory void creates ambiguity around issues such as data sovereignty, intellectual property rights 
for AI-generated outputs, and the liability of AI systems. A coordinated legal framework, as well as a pronounced value 
principle rooted in international best practices but adapted to the Lao context, is urgently needed to guide responsible AI 
deployment and build trust among citizens and businesses.
Sociocultural Barriers to Digital Inclusion
While gender inclusivity in the digital sphere has seen marked progress, participation and comprehension of digital 
technologies among rural communities remains limited due to infrastructure gaps, affordability, and digital literacy disparities. 
The success of recent initiatives with international organizations in delivering digital services demonstrates what is possible, 
but also underscores the need for sustained investments in local capacity, outreach, and trust-building. Additionally, digital 
transformation efforts must include intentional cultural preservation strategies, particularly in the development of a culturally 
aware dataset and tools for natural language processing (NLP). While international collaborations have significantly advanced 
NLP development in Lao, further involvement of local researchers and cultural experts would help ensure that tools are 
contextually appropriate and reflective of Laos’ linguistic richness.
Education and Research Limitations
The development of AI talent and innovation in Laos is hindered by a lack of robust academic and research ecosystems. 
Computer Science, Software Engineering, and related disciplines are not only small, but often siloed within higher education

### Page 23

21
institutions, with minimal cross-disciplinary collaboration. Research output is still limited, and AI/ICT-related curricula in 
higher education and K-12 have only been introduced in recent years. Without significant public and private investment in 
universities, schools, research centers and incentives for cross-domain collaboration, Laos risks becoming a passive consumer 
of foreign technologies rather than an active participant in the global AI landscape. The increasing availability of global AI 
tools presents an opportunity, but without local adaptation and leadership, these technologies may not always reflect the 
unique context of Laos. The Minister of Technology and Communications noted that fewer than 5% of Laos’ workforce is in 
high-end digital fields such as AI, data science, or software development, well below national targets. The Ministry’s 2030 
vision seeks to double this share, requiring reforms in education, training, and public–private collaboration. The government 
also acknowledges the lack of a dedicated AI lab or nationally developed model, relying largely on imported tools. To address 
these gaps, the Minister has proposed creating a public AI lab, establishing a national research fund, and strengthening 
industry-academia collaboration.
Economic Dependence and Investment Priorities
Laos continues to rely heavily on extractive industries and maintains a large informal economy, which limits the country’s 
capacity to invest in high-tech sectors. While digital entrepreneurship is emerging, particularly in e-commerce and fintech, 
much of this growth is dependent on foreign platforms and imported tools. This dependency not only undermines national 
digital sovereignty but also restricts local innovation. To address this, Laos will need to shift investment priorities toward 
supporting homegrown tech startups, digital SMEs, and innovation hubs that can build context-specific AI applications and 
reduce reliance on external ecosystems.
Technological and Infrastructure Deficiencies
Fundamental limitations in digital infrastructure remain a major constraint, especially outside urban areas. Internet penetration, 
bandwidth availability, and access to computing resources are insufficient to support advanced AI applications across the 
country. This exacerbates the urban-rural divide and restricts AI development to a handful of companies and institutions in 
Vientiane and other urban centers. Strategic investments in national connectivity, high-performance computing, and open 
data infrastructure will be vital to ensuring equitable access to AI technologies and services. 
Cross-sectoral Collaboration and Coordination Challenges
Another key barrier to AI adoption is the siloed nature of governance. While ministries have engaged in digital initiatives 
through the National Committee, stronger coordination and harmonization across all stakeholders in AI including non-
government actors would enhance synergies and optimize resource use.
STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS FOR AI ADOPTION
Addressing these challenges is not just about improving efficiency: it is a strategic imperative. AI is set to drive global 
economic growth, and for Laos, it offers a path to diversify beyond a narrow economic base and limited labor productivity. 
Automation, intelligent systems, and AI-enabled platforms can help address labor shortages, enhance public services, 
and boost productivity in key economic sectors.
However, reliance on foreign AI technologies and expertise poses long-term risks to national sovereignty, economic resilience, 
and cultural autonomy. Building domestic capabilities in AI development, regulation, and ethical oversight will be crucial 
for Laos to control its digital assets and shape AI in line with national values, positioning the country as a regional actor 
committed to ethical, inclusive, and context-driven innovation.

This section will discuss the legal and regulatory aspects of AI adoption in Laos. The regulatory framework around the general 
information technology sector in which AI is/will be deployed is crucial to ensuring the ethical deployment of AI systems. 
The legal and regulatory framework should include effective mechanisms for safeguarding and upholding citizens’ rights, 
as well as monitoring, mitigating, and compensating for any unforeseen adverse outcomes resulting from the deployment 
of AI systems. Examples of the legal framework include regulations concerning AI, data protection and privacy, data sharing 
and accessibility, and freedom of information, among others.
NATIONAL AI STRATEGY
As of August 2025, the Government of Lao PDR is in the process of drafting its national AI strategy, which aims to incorporate 
key recommendations from this report to strengthen and complement the final framework. This national AI strategy is 
expected to be finalized and ratified in the beginning of Q4 2025. The draft strategy is structured around seven core pillars: (1) 
legislation and governance; (2) human resource development; (3) digital and information infrastructure; (4) AI research and 
development; (5) support for AI entrepreneurship; (6) broader adoption of AI across sectors; and (7) international cooperation 
and integration. Each strategic pillar includes concrete steps and measurable targets; for instance, the research and 
development strategy outlines the expected number of academic publications. The strategy is designed to be implemented 
over a five-year period and recommends the establishment of a national coordination mechanism to monitor the progress. 
While budgetary estimates for proposed activities are included, specific funding commitments have yet to be finalized.
The drafting of the national strategy is spearheaded by the ARIST (Applied Research Institute of Smart Technology), an agency 
under the Ministry of Technology and Communications. In the drafting of this, ARIST invites all relevant ministries, private 
sectors, and institutions for their comments and feedback.
AI-SPECIFIC REGULATION
The country has made significant progress in charting its digital transformation journey, guided by the three foundational 
pillars of digital governance, digital economy, and digital society, backed with a suite of national strategies, including the 
20-Year National Digital Economy Development Vision (2021–2040)3, the 10-Year Strategy (2021–2030), and the 5-Year Plan 
(2021–2025). These strategies demonstrate a strong commitment to advancing digital infrastructure, innovation, and service 
delivery. 
Despite the progress in digital transformation, AI has only very recently begun to emerge in formal policy discourse. Aside 
from the mentioned National Strategy on AI, it appears briefly in the 2025 Draft Decree on Digital Transformation, specifically 
in Articles 17, 18, and 21, which position AI primarily as a tool to boost the digital economy4. Another recognition of AI’s 
significance is found in the revised national constitution5, where Article 24 now explicitly calls for the promotion of intelligence

### Page 25

23
and creativity in the research, analysis, and application of science, technology, innovation, and AI. This constitutional 
amendment reflects a growing awareness of AI’s potential and the state’s role in nurturing scientific talent to support 
industrialization and modernization. Aside from the stated acknowledgements, the current policy environment still has 
challenges in setting up the regulatory clarity required to govern AI systems responsibly. While precedents from other law 
artefacts such as Data Protection Law and Cyber Crime law can be leveraged, there are no specific legal provisions that address 
issues such as transparency in AI interactions, mechanisms for monitoring and redress, access to algorithmic decision-making 
processes by regulators or courts, or liability for harms caused by AI systems.

DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY LAW
Laos enacted its data protection law in 20176, establishing a legal framework for safeguarding personal information. The law 
grants individuals control over their data, including the right to delete it, and incorporates a notice and consent framework 
that generally applies to data collection and processing activities. Additionally, it mandates transparency regarding data 
usage, ensuring that individuals are informed about how their data is handled.
However, the law does not include requirements for data minimization, nor does it specify cases where a data protection 
or privacy impact assessment is required. It does set strict rules for handling sensitive information, explicitly prohibiting 
the collection of data related to race, ethnicity, political opinions, religious beliefs, sexual behavior, criminal history, health 
information, or any other data that may affect national security, peace, and social order.
Enforcement mechanisms and compensation schemes are incorporated into the law, allowing for penalties in case of 
violations. While there is no distinction in data protection standards between public and private entities, government agencies 
are governed by a separate decree on digital government released in 2021. The overall efficacy of the law remains an open 
question, as no formal assessment of its impact has been reported.
While progress is being made, Laos still trails the Asia-Pacific regional average in cybersecurity and data protection, as reflected 
in its 2024 Global Cybersecurity Index assessment7. Its strongest areas are Legal Measures (10.38) and Cooperation Measures 
(9.61), yet it lags behind the regional benchmark across all pillars: most notably in Capacity Development (2.05), followed by 
Organizational Measures (5.52) and Technical Measures (6.18). Classified as Tier 4: Evolving, Lao PDR has a solid foundation 
in legal and collaborative frameworks but requires targeted investment to close the gap, particularly in capacity building 
and institutional strengthening.
Data Sharing and Accessibility
Laos has made progress in open data and data sharing through the Decree on Digital Government8, signed by the Prime 
Minister in 2021, which establishes a framework for open government data. Under this decree, government data in digital 
form is publicly available and freely accessible to individuals, legal entities, and organizations, including those in the private 
sector. Users are permitted to access, use, copy, share, and modify open data, provided it does not violate the law or involve 
commercial trading of state data.
The provision of open government data follows key principles, including accuracy, completeness, accessibility via the internet, 
and cost-free availability. Additionally, data disclosure is prioritized based on societal needs while ensuring compliance with 
electronic data protection laws. However, ministries, agencies, and local authority are not liable for any damages resulting from 
the use of open government data. The specific creation and categorization of open data are outlined in separate regulations.

### Page 26

International organizations have supported open data initiatives in the country, such as the World Bank’s Open Data Initiatives9 
and the Open Development Mekong Initiative10. Despite these efforts, challenges remain in improving data availability. 
According to the Open Data Inventory (ODIN), Laos scored 46 overall, with 39 in coverage and 52 in openness, indicating 
limited accessibility, particularly in social statistics11. The country ranks 9th in the region, ahead of only Cambodia and Timor-
Leste, highlighting significant room for improvement in expanding open data access and usability. The country is also not a 
signatory to the Open Data Charter12.

PROCUREMENT LAWS AND POLICIES
In Laos, public procurement, including the procurement of technology, is governed by the Public Procurement Law, which 
has been in effect since November 201713. This law upholds key principles such as transparency, fairness, and accountability 
in the use of government funds. However, it does not contain specific provisions related to computing technologies or the 
procurement of AI systems.
For businesses operating in the information technology (IT) sector, the regulatory framework is defined by multiple laws. 
Under the Law on Enterprises (Amended), No. 74/NA, dated 29 December 2022, any individual or entity seeking to operate 
a business in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic must obtain a business license from the Ministry of Industry and 
Commerce14. This license serves as the legal basis for conducting commercial activities in the country.
In addition, the Law on Information and Communications Technology (ICT), No. 02/NA, dated 11 July 2016, mandates 
that businesses operating in the ICT sector must acquire a specialized license from the Ministry of Technology and 
Communications. This requirement applies to enterprises involved in software development, IT services, telecommunications, 
and other digital fields15.
Although these laws are not AI-specific, they provide a regulatory entry point for the government to oversee and hold 
accountable businesses that develop or deploy AI technologies. By enforcing licensing requirements and sectoral oversight, 
the government has an opportunity to ensure responsible conduct among AI providers within the broader ICT framework.
FREEDOM OF INFORMATION AND ACCESS TO KNOWLEDGE
In the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, the legal framework for public access to information is evolving. Incorporating data 
access provisions into future laws could enhance openness in AI governance, while also enriching AI systems with localized 
data inputs that reflect the national context and contribute to globally relevant datasets.
The Law on Media allows the creation of media outlets under Lao law16, which can help disseminate information related 
to AI products and deployment through the media. The Law on Information and Communication Technology (ICT) permits 
individuals and organizations to use ICT tools, supporting access to digital content. The Decree on Internet Information 
Management ensures citizens can access and use the internet, so long as they comply with national regulations17. However,

### Page 27

25
none of these laws require public or private institutions to release data or respond to information requests, let alone specific 
about deployment and issues around technological tools like AI.
The Consumer Protection Law (2010) only provides limited transparency by ensuring consumers have access to product 
and service information, including in the domain of science and technology18. It is enforced by multiple ministries, with the 
Ministry of Industry and Commerce (MOIC) acting as the lead agency through its Division of Consumer Protection.

DUE PROCESS AND ACCOUNTABILITY
The legal framework surrounding AI-related due process is also still under development, with opportunities to strengthen 
protections and remedies for individuals affected by automated systems. Individuals impacted by automated decision-making 
systems currently have limited or no clear legal recourse to challenge, appeal, or understand the basis of such decisions. 
Existing legal instruments, including the Criminal and Civil Codes, and the regulations mentioned in this section, for example: 
the Consumer Protection Law (2010), the Law on Information and Communication Technology (ICT), and the Data Protection 
and Privacy Law, do not contain specific provisions that guarantee the right to be heard, the right to explanation, or access 
to remedies in cases where AI decisions cause harm or unfair treatment.
ONLINE SAFETY AND INTEGRITY OF SPEECH
The Law on Prevention and Combating Cyber Crime, enacted on July 15, 2015, provides a legal framework for preventing, 
investigating, and penalizing cyber-related offenses19. It defines cybercrime offenses such as unauthorized access, 
data interference, system interference, computer-related forgery and fraud, dissemination of malicious software, distribution 
of pornographic material and ‘damages’ through social media. The law defines social media ‘damages’ as actions that harm 
national security, social order, and cultural values that include spreading false or misleading information, inciting violence, 
encouraging resistance against the government, promoting illegal activities such as drug and weapon sales, and sharing 
defamatory or offensive content online. Currently, there are no formal evaluations. However, there are different expressions 
by some foreign organizations regarding the clarity and interpretation of the law.Public Sector Capacity
Laos’ public sector digital transformation is progressing from a ‘digitally nascent’ to a ‘digitally emerging’ stage, as highlighted 
by the UNDP’s Digital Maturity Assessment (2022)20. This shift reflects a move from having only minimal, fragmented digital 
capabilities toward establishing basic online services, initial policy frameworks, and early ICT infrastructure investments, 
marking steady progress while still being in the early phases of transformation. Ministries currently rate slightly higher (1.8/5) 
than provinces (1.3/5), signaling early but uneven progress (check figure 3). Ongoing initiatives to improve innovation, digital 
skills, and institutional coordination present strong opportunities for capacity building, especially when scaled through 
national programs and inter-ministerial collaboration.

To address these gaps, the Lao government has actively partnered with international organizations. Key initiatives include 
the development of the Lao Gov X platform with UNDP (2023-ongoing)21, the Government Data Strategy with UN DESA 
(2023-ongoing), and AI-related efforts such as “Generative AI for Sustainable Urbanization” with UN-Habitat (2024)22 and “AI and 
Foresight” with UNDP23. Support has also been extended to high-level training, such as the upcoming Digital Policy Leadership 
program (2025) and the implementation of the national Digital Government Strategy (2025-2026) supported by the UN.
Despite these efforts, Laos still lacks large-scale, government-led public sector upskilling initiatives that extend beyond 
sporadic workshops and pilot programs. The 2023-2024 national workshop data shows over 40 events, including training on 
e-Government tools, cybersecurity, AI, digital identity, and Internet of Things, often in collaboration with foreign institutions 
such as NIPA Korea, UNICEF, and universities in China and Thailand. However, these remain largely fragmented and short-term. 
Interviews with the Ministry of Labor suggest a willingness to engage in pilot AI initiatives, particularly those that enhance 
job matching and digital skills development. However, due to limited internal resources and competing policy priorities, 
such initiatives would likely require external support. The Ministry has expressed interest in collaborating with MTC and MoES 
to align labor market forecasting tools with evolving digital curricula, although no formal mechanism for such coordination 
currently exists.
To move forward, Laos will need to consolidate these efforts into coherent, government-owned programs that emphasize 
institutionalization, scalability, and sustainability, particularly in building digital and AI capacity across ministries and provinces.

This section explores the social and cultural dimensions relevant to the ethical deployment of AI systems in the context of 
Laos. These dimensions are vital in addressing potential biases throughout the AI lifecycle and in building a fair, inclusive AI 
ecosystem. In the Lao context, this includes promoting greater participation of women in science, technology, engineering, 
and mathematics (STEM) fields, including AI-related sectors, and ensuring that AI development reflects the country’s rich ethnic 
and cultural diversity. It also involves understanding public attitudes and the general level of acceptance of AI technologies 
among different communities across the country, which is essential for responsible and equitable implementation.
GENDER GAP
One critical metric in measuring whether there’s a disparity along gender lines in technology inclusion is the gender gap 
in internet use. Laos has a score of 0.972 in the Digital Gender Gap Index24, which indicates relatively high digital access 
and inclusion compared to regional neighbors and peers (0.7 - 0.94). However, disparities in STEM education and career 
aspirations remain substantial.
In Laos, the proportion of women graduating from STEM programs at the tertiary level remains considerably lower than that of 
men. Based on the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Report, 12.79% of female students attained STEM education 
compared to 32.47% of male students25. This imbalance underscores the need for targeted interventions to promote gender 
inclusivity in STEM fields from an early stage. Furthermore, gender differences in career aspirations persist, with fewer high-
achieving girls in science and mathematics expecting to pursue STEM professions by the age of 30. This finding from the PISA 
2018 report26 indicates that societal and structural barriers continue to limit women’s participation in these fields.
The country has devised a National Plan for Gender Equality, which provides a comprehensive framework for promoting 
gender equality across all sectors, including technology and digital access27. Although specific policies targeting the digital 
gender gap remain limited, the law establishes a foundation for broader initiatives to enhance women’s participation in the 
digital economy.
Additionally, the Lao PDR Gender Equality Strategy 2022-2026, developed by UNDP Lao PDR, includes provisions for digital 
literacy and skills development as part of efforts to enhance women’s economic empowerment28. The strategy aims to equip 
women with the necessary tools to engage meaningfully in the digital world, recognizing that digital inclusion is fundamental 
to gender equity in STEM and technology fields.
Other international initiatives such as DigitALL: Innovation and Technology for Gender Equality, led by UN Women29, further 
emphasize the importance of digital literacy programs for women and girls. These programs focus on increasing access 
to technology, particularly in rural areas, and supporting women-led businesses in the digital economy. Such efforts are 
crucial in bridging the gender gap in AI and IT sectors, where women remain underrepresented in leadership roles, research, 
and development.

The digital divide between urban and rural areas in Laos is evident in technology adoption, digital literacy, and infrastructure 
development. A major factor in this divide is the disparity in population concentration and economic development. 
Vientiane, the economic and administrative hub of Laos, consistently leads in digital adoption - the district reported 81% 
coverage in internet users compared to the total population based on the survey done by the Ministry of Technology and 
Communications, meanwhile other more rural, agriculturally heavy regions like Savannakhet and Khammouane still have 
less than 50% coverage.
The Lao People’s Democratic Republic has implemented a multi-faceted policy framework to address this digital divide 
between urban and rural areas as part of its broader inclusive development agenda. The National Green Growth Strategy of 
the Lao PDR (2018) serves as a cornerstone policy that promotes inclusive and sustainable development with explicit aims 
to reduce disparities between urban and rural communities, across ethnic groups, and between genders30. This strategy 
emphasizes equitable access to resources and opportunities as fundamental to reducing persistent socioeconomic gaps 
throughout the country. 
Complementing this approach, Laos has established comprehensive development plans spanning 5, 10, and 20-year horizons 
that progressively integrate digital technologies into the national socio-economic framework. The 5-year plan focuses on 
establishing foundational elements of a digital economy, society, and government, with targeted initiatives to enhance digital 
infrastructure, promote digital literacy, and encourage innovation specifically designed to bridge the digital divide between 
urban and rural populations. Building on these foundations, the 10-year development plan accelerates digital transformation 
across various sectors, including public administration and private enterprise, with the goal of improving productivity and 
service delivery to systematically reduce socioeconomic disparities.
ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY POLICIES
Laos, whose biggest export is electricity, is often dubbed the “Battery of Southeast Asia.” This power is primarily generated from 
its vast hydropower resources, although coal remains a backup during periods of drought that strain generation capacity31. 
Against this backdrop, the country has set ambitious climate goals: cutting emissions by 60% by 2030 and achieving net-zero 
by 2050 under its NDC 2.0 commitments (figure 4)32.

As AI emerges as a resource-heavy technology: demanding both substantial energy and reliable cooling, Laos sees an 
opportunity to align its hydropower surplus advantage with digital growth. Although no explicit government regulation on 
strategy has been set up, in June 2025, the government signed an MoU to explore the development of green, hydropower-
driven data centers, including an AI Innovation Centre and a 150-hectare AI Special Economic Zone in Vientiane33. This initiative 
is seen to kick start the positioning of the country as a hub for sustainable AI infrastructure, advancing both its economic 
ambitions and its climate commitments.

HEALTH AND SOCIAL WELL-BEING
The country has established a comprehensive Digital Health Strategy for 2023-2027, designed to create a sustainable digital 
health ecosystem that enhances healthcare delivery and outcomes throughout the country34. This national framework is built 
upon five strategic priorities: workforce development (to build and strengthen human resource capabilities in digital health 
technologies and management); governance structure implementation; standards implementation (to establish consistent 
data protocols for efficient information exchange); application development (to create shared registries and comprehensive 
national management information systems); and infrastructure enhancement to strengthen computing and networking 
capabilities supporting digital health initiatives. 
The strategy adopts a holistic approach to healthcare improvement, with implicit rather than explicit focus on comprehensive 
physical and mental health outcomes, primarily emphasizing system-level efficiency improvements designed to enhance 
overall service delivery. The digital health policy also does not specifically address AI technologies despite their growing 
importance in healthcare globally. Additionally, no provisions explicitly address the unique impacts of digital health 
technologies or AI on children’s health or healthcare needs. The efficacy of the digital health policy has not yet been formally 
assessed, suggesting a need for robust evaluation frameworks. 
Aside from this digital health strategy, the country also has many partnerships with international organizations to introduce 
digital transformation in the health sector. Some examples include (1) the development of an Electronic Immunization Registry, 
a project spearheaded by UNICEF and WHO to replace traditional paper-based vaccination records. This system enhances 
immunization tracking and health planning across the country by providing real-time, digital access to immunization data35. 
(2) The Village Health Volunteers program, which equips community health workers with digital tools for outreach and 
reporting36, and (3) the planned DHIS2 Climate App, which integrates environmental data into health systems37. Together, 
these initiatives aim to modernize Lao’s healthcare infrastructure, improve efficiency, and support public health policy through 
better data.
PUBLIC TRUST AND E-GOVERNMENT SYSTEMS
Laos is actively pursuing digital transformation to enhance governance, economic productivity, and citizen services. 
Key initiatives include the Digital Government Transformation Project (in partnership with UNDP), the Digital Economy 
Strategy (2021-2030), and the National Digital Economy Development Plan (2021-2025), aimed at modernizing public 
administration and the private sector. The e-Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (e-CRVS) system digitizes vital records38, while 
the e-Learning Management Information System (e-LMIS) enhances education access and monitoring. The National Data

### Page 32

30
Center (LaoDC) centralizes government data for better service delivery and security39. The Lao Gov X initiative, developed 
with UNDP, aims to centralize government services within a single digital platform, improving accessibility and efficiency. 
Other efforts include Lao Digital Week to promote innovation40, digital government administration systems (e-Office, G-Drive, 
etc.), and the LaoKYC application for digital vaccination records. 
Despite these efforts, Laos is still in the early stages of digital public service development amongst Southeast Asia for online 
government services and public participation in digital governance, with an Online Services Index (OSI) score of 0.3265 and 
an E-Participation Index (EPI) score of 0.2877 (United Nations, 2024), only slightly ahead of Myanmar41 (figure 5). These scores 
suggest limited accessibility, usability, and engagement with digital public services, reflecting challenges in user-centricity 
and digital inclusivity, with room for continued progress.

Aside from the trust level and progression on digital transformation initiatives that have been enacted by the government, 
our survey of AI readiness addressed to stakeholders in our engagements (detailed in chapter 2 on stakeholders) indicates 
that public trust in AI in general is high, with 95% of respondents having a high degree of trust in AI implementation.

CONTENT, CULTURAL PRESERVATION AND HERITAGE
Laos boasts a rich cultural heritage recognized by UNESCO, encompassing both historical landmarks and vibrant traditional 
practices. The country’s UNESCO World Heritage Sites include Luang Prabang, the spiritual heart of Laos known for its 
historic Buddhist temples; Wat Phou, an ancient Khmer temple complex in Champasak; and the Plain of Jars, a mysterious 
megalithic archaeological site. Beyond physical sites, Laos also safeguards intangible cultural treasures such as Khaen music 
and Naga pattern weaving. Theravada Buddhism deeply shapes Lao society, influencing religious observances, festivals like 
Boun Pi Mai (Lao New Year), and social values rooted in respect and modesty. Traditional arts, including weaving, pottery,

### Page 33

31
and wood carving, continue to thrive, alongside music and dance forms such as lam vong, often accompanied by the iconic 
khene instrument.
In recent years, digital technology has played a growing role in preserving and promoting this cultural heritage. Local 
authorities in Luang Prabang, for instance, have developed mobile applications to support cultural tourism and awareness. 
In the field of AI, several initiatives have focused on the Lao language. These include tools like LaoNLP42 and LaoPLM43, as well 
as regional collaborations such as SEA-LION44, spearheaded by Singapore, which includes Lao as part of broader Southeast 
Asian language modeling efforts.
However, despite these advancements, much of the development in Lao language technologies is still driven by foreign 
researchers, particularly from China and Thailand. Aside from the Lao-to-English open-source dataset provided by the former 
Ministry of Post and Telecommunications (now the Ministry of Technology and Communications) for Google45, the majority of 
language tools are built outside of Laos. This reliance on foreign-led initiatives presents a cultural risk, as externally developed 
models may overlook or misrepresent local nuances that only native Lao speakers fully comprehend.
Recognizing this challenge, there are now local efforts to reclaim agency in the development of Lao AI tools. Notably, UNICEF, 
in partnership with the Ministry of Technology and Communications (MTC), launched a project in late 2024 to train machine 
learning models in both Lao and English. This initiative involves scanning historical Laotian textbooks and using their contents 
to develop Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text (STT) systems. The project aims not only to enhance digital accessibility 
for Lao speakers but also to embed cultural context into AI systems, ensuring that technological progress supports, rather 
than erodes, the preservation of Laos’s unique linguistic and cultural identity.

SCIENTIFIC AND EDUCATIONAL
46	 UNESCO: Bulk Data Download Service 
47	 Lao Gazette - Law on Science and Technology 
In this section, the scientific and educational dimensions supporting AI adoption in Laos will be discussed. As scientific 
and educational foundations play a crucial role in advancing AI capabilities, evaluating these dimensions is essential for 
understanding the country’s readiness for AI development. The scientific dimension is assessed through Lao’s performance 
in research and innovation (R&I), including factors such as research and development (R&D) spending, volume and quality 
of research output, ethical considerations in AI research, and innovation in AI-related talent. Meanwhile, the educational 
dimension is evaluated by examining the country’s progress in areas such as national education strategies, educational 
infrastructure, curriculum development, learning outcomes, and public accessibility to AI education and training.
R&D EXPENDITURES
Reliable and up-to-date data on research and development (R&D) expenditure in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic 
remains limited. The most recent available figure dates back to 2002, when R&D investment was recorded at 0.04% of GDP, 
according to data from the UNESCO Institute for Statistics46. This figure falls significantly below the regional average for 
Southeast Asia at the time, which stood at approximately 0.5%, indicating a low level of national investment in science, 
technology, and innovation.
In recent years, however, the Government of Laos has demonstrated renewed commitment to strengthening the science and 
technology sector. This commitment has been codified in the 2025 constitutional amendment, which explicitly mandates 
the promotion of intelligence and creativity through the advancement of scientific research, analysis, and the application 
of science, technology, innovation, and AI. Complementing this constitutional provision, the 2022 Law on Science and 
Technology stipulates that:
“The State shall prioritize investment in research and development of science and technology by one percent 
(1%) of the investment budget each year and may increase [this allocation] when deemed necessary and in 
accordance with actual conditions.”47
While these legal and policy frameworks signify important steps forward in promoting science and technology, 
the effectiveness of their implementation, and the extent to which they translate into tangible improvements in R&D 
investment and outputs, require further monitoring and evaluation.
RESEARCH OUTPUTS AND ETHICAL AI RESEARCH
Researchers from Laos have yet to publish in top AI conferences and publications like CVPR, NeuRIPS and NAACL, and there are 
currently no publications by Laotians or featuring Laos as a subject in research venues on AI ethics such as ACM’s FAccT. Based 
on OECD data on AI research publication, Laos is lagging in terms of publication in comparison with closest-in-performance 
regional neighbors Myanmar and Cambodia, producing less than 10 publications per year in the last several years, less than 
half of those produced by regional neighbouring countries (see figure 6).

Scientific publications in Laos are predominantly in the form of local-language textbooks and limited-circulation local 
journals, which restricts their visibility and impact. Per a UNESCO mapping of research and innovation in Laos, the most 
papers published and collaborated on are in the public health domain. This limited publication output in the computing 
domain contributes to the scarcity of reputable computing/ICT conferences in the country, particularly those focused on 
AI or AI ethics.
AI research in Laos faces significant constraints due to limited funding opportunities. While the government offers competitive 
research grants, these are generally aimed at broad science and technology fields and do not specifically prioritize AI. 
Consequently, most AI-related projects stall at the model development stage, lacking a structured pipeline for scaling and 
operational deployment. Discussions with researchers and university professors reveal that this funding gap fosters a donor-
dependent research culture, where academics are less motivated to pursue independent research agendas and instead align 
their work primarily with donor priorities.
Without sustained investment in research infrastructure, targeted funding, and faculty development, Laos is likely to fall 
further behind regional peers in advancing AI research and innovation.
48	 OECD AI Research Data
AI TALENT
The National University of Laos (NUOL) is the only institution in the country that offers a computer science program at both 
undergraduate and master’s levels. In the program, AI is primarily embedded within broader subjects such as data science, 
machine learning, deep learning, and data mining, with final-year students required to develop AI models and implement 
them in mobile or web applications. 
There are no dedicated AI research laboratories, and research efforts are largely limited to thesis projects, with no large-scale AI 
initiatives or applied research programs in place. Beyond NUOL’s computer science department, AI instruction is also embedded 
within the Faculty of Engineering’s programs, especially in departments such as Electronics and Telecommunications, as well

### Page 36

34
as supplementary material in other departments such as civil engineering, etc. These departments offer coursework and 
research in areas like big data, AI for their vertical, and smart techniques through IoT. 
Despite AI being embedded in other departments, interdisciplinary collaboration within the university remains limited due 
to logistical and geographic constraints between faculties. A key challenge repeatedly cited by engaged stakeholders was 
the inadequacy of infrastructure, as GPU availability is virtually minimum, and the university’s data center operates with 
outdated equipment. Moreover, English language proficiency among students and faculty is a major barrier to engaging 
with global AI research or securing international grants.
This ecosystem produced some notable student projects, such as AI models for air quality prediction (PM 2.5), license plate 
recognition, and facial recognition, but these projects remain at the conceptual level due to budget constraints and a lack of 
resources for further development or commercialization. No AI-related patents or real-world applications have emerged from 
these projects, reflecting the limited pathways available for cultivating AI talent with hands-on experience in production-
level systems.
The Laos higher education ecosystem has only a small number of universities, with five public institutions: NUOL, Champasak 
University (CU), Souphanouvong University (SU), Savannakhet University (SKU), and the University of Health Sciences. Higher 
education is supplemented by teacher training colleges, private colleges, and a few upgraded institutes offering bachelor’s 
degrees. This severely limits the size of the AI talent pool the country can develop. These efforts are further hampered by 
small department sizes: NUOL’s computer science department, for instance, has a maximum enrollment of 60 students per 
year but often achieves only half that.
There is also a lack of PhD holders in the field across Lao universities. NUOL’s computer science department has only four PhD 
faculty members, indicating a shortage of senior researchers capable of leading and sustaining high-impact AI initiatives. 
Outside of academia, there are no known Kaggle grandmasters or independent or industry-based AI researchers active in 
Laos, further reflecting the limited ecosystem for AI development and innovation.

50	 Patent on Lao OCR 
51	 Patent on Text Classification 
INNOVATION OUTPUTS
According to data from the OECD and WIPO, there are currently no AI-related patents originating from Laos. However, 
consistent with trends observed in natural language technology tools and datasets discussed earlier, several AI applications 
designed for Lao use, such as license plate recognition49, OCR50, and text classification51, have been patented by foreign 
researchers, without collaboration with or acknowledgment of Lao researchers and innovators. This highlights a missed 
opportunity and a potential risk to the development of homegrown innovation.
As previously noted, research in Laos often struggles to transition into practical applications due to a limited industrial base 
and weak international partnerships. For instance, although the NUOL has a Memorandum of Understanding with Lao 
Telecom (Laotel), their collaboration has been confined to training programs and sponsorships for Laotel employees pursuing 
master’s degrees, with no active AI research projects emerging from the partnership. Furthermore, there are no known AI 
collaborations between Lao universities and institutions in the broader Southeast Asian region. This isolation significantly limits 
knowledge exchange, access to frontier research, and opportunities for joint AI initiatives that could drive local innovation.

54	 UNESCO: AI Competency Framework for Teachers 
Laos has integrated ICT education into its national curriculum since 2013, with students learning basic computing skills, 
such as using office applications, from primary school. The 10-year digital strategy for education (2025-2035), supported by 
UNESCO and UNICEF, aims to further strengthen digital competencies for both students and teachers.
The Khang Panya learning platform, developed in partnership with UNICEF, the EU, and the Global Partnership for Education, 
has been established to prevent learning loss during COVID, and has provided digital learning resources for students and 
teachers52. Importantly, this platform is designed to function offline, addressing some of the connectivity challenges faced 
in rural areas.
AI education is undergoing integration into the school curriculum. The current curriculum includes some mention of AI, 
although the focus remains on basic digital literacy as stated above. A curriculum update currently underway aims to 
introduce more substantial AI topics, supported by a new Science, Technology, and Innovation (STI) strategy53 (see figure 
7). The strategy includes efforts to align AI education across both primary and secondary education and emphasizes the 
importance of teacher certification in ICT to ensure quality delivery.

The latter part of teacher quality is a major concern and challenge in AI readiness for K-12 education. The government 
has partnered with various stakeholders, including UNESCO, UNICEF, China, and the Australian embassy to close the gap. 
Furthermore, In 2024, MoES conducted a national competency assessment for teachers, adopting UNESCO’s AI Competency 
Framework for Teachers54 to gauge preparedness for integrating AI concepts into classroom instruction. However, challenges 
persist in teacher training and English language capability, particularly in rural areas where generalist teachers are responsible 
for teaching all subjects, including ICT and English.
EDUCATION INFRASTRUCTURE
Despite policy-level advancements and partnerships with international institutions, infrastructure limitations pose a significant 
barrier to AI readiness in K-12 education. As noted in the previous section on urban/rural divides in internet coverage,

### Page 38

36
many rural schools lack stable internet access, making AI-driven education solutions inaccessible in certain regions. Based 
on UNESCO data in 2024, only 5.36% primary schools have access to the internet for pedagogical purposes55.
While some initiatives started by the government and international institutions provide free data packages, the availability 
of computers, tablets, and digital learning devices remains insufficient, particularly outside urban centers. Only 11.13% of 
primary schools have access to computers for pedagogical purposes56.

EDUCATION ATTAINMENT
Laos faces significant challenges in building an AI-ready workforce due to persistently low levels of doctoral education. 
According to UNESCO data, only 0.5% of the population held a doctoral degree in 2010, and declined further to 0.04% 
by 201557 (see figure 8). This is reflected in the country’s limited academic capacity, taking the previous example of NUOL, 
with only four faculty members holding PhDs in the sole computer science department. While advanced degree attainment 
remains low, there are recent policy efforts and international scholarships enacted to create pathways and expand doctoral-
level education in STEM and AI-related fields.

While 23.1% of tertiary graduates (Laos has a 9.6% tertiary education attainment rate) come from STEM fields, 12% of that share 
is concentrated in engineering and construction58, areas that might not be related to AI. Broader access to AI-relevant skills 
through alternative pathways is also lacking. Laos is not rated in the Coursera Global Skills Report59, making it the only ASEAN 
country besides Brunei without measurable participation in global online learning platforms. These indicators underscore 
the urgent need to expand both formal and informal AI-related education opportunities in Laos.

### Page 39

37
Currently, Laos has no dedicated tertiary education programs in AI, data science, or machine learning. However, some adjacent 
fields, such as computer science (with only one program nationwide), software engineering, computer engineering, statistics, 
and vocational ICT education, are available. 
AI is still largely seen as a technical skill, with limited involvement from other scientific disciplines and minimal collaboration 
between departments, leading to siloed curricula. Consequently, courses that combine technical and ethical aspects of AI 
remain rare. Outside of formal education, public-facing AI workshops, such as one for students in rural areas, have been held 
by the Ministry of Technology and Communications (MTC)60. However, these initiatives are typically offline, non-recurring, 
and lack sustained accessibility.

where AI systems are developed and implemented, particularly those related to the labor market, spending on intermediate 
goods and services, and investment in AI-related production. In Laos, the dynamism and skill level of the workforce, together 
with the country’s capacity to invest in and support AI development through intermediate consumption and production, 
are critical indicators for assessing how ready and capable the ecosystem is to adopt and benefit from AI technologies.
GENERAL OVERVIEW OF THE ECONOMY
Laos has a large informal economy; a survey conducted by the International Labor Organization and the Lao Statistics bureau 
found that 73 percent of men and 87 percent of women in the country are self-employed61 (see figure 9). This situation led to 
a smaller digital economy of 3%, per World Bank’s data - lagging behind regional neighbors in South East Asia like Singapore 
(17.3%) and Indonesia (6%)62. The limited digital economy will significantly hamper AI adoption as use cases will remain limited.

Despite the limited impact, some sectors in Lao, especially through private companies has leveraged AI in their operations63, 
such as:
	•
Telecommunications: Companies like Lao Telecommunications Company (LTC) and Unitel (Star Telecom) apply AI for 
customer service chatbots, network optimization, and predictive maintenance to improve service reliability and user 
experience. Star Telecom also uses AI to personalize mobile plans and analyze customer data.
	•
Banking and Finance: Banks such as Banque pour le Commerce Exterieur Lao Public (BCEL), Phongsavanh Bank 
(PSVB), and Lao-Viet Bank (LVB) utilize AI for fraud detection, automated loan processing, customer support chatbots, 
and personalized financial services.

	•
E-commerce and Retail: Platforms like Passa Lao and Vientiane Center Lao use AI to analyze consumer behavior, provide 
personalized recommendations, optimize product placement, and tailor promotions for better customer engagement.
	•
Logistics and Transportation: Lao Post and Loca integrate AI for route planning, logistics optimization, real-time ride 
matching, and predictive analytics, significantly improving delivery and mobility services.
	•
Insurance and Financial Services: J&C Services applies AI to streamline insurance claims and deliver customized 
customer service experiences.
	•
Manufacturing and Industry: Companies such as Lao Brewery Company (LBC), Lao Asia Pacific Brewery (LAPB), 
Lao Cement Company (LCC), Lao Tobacco Company, and Khanthaly Concrete employ AI for supply chain management, 
production optimization, predictive maintenance, and market forecasting.
	•
Energy and Resources: Petroleum Trading Lao (PTL) leverages AI for logistics planning, supply chain efficiency, 
and dynamic fuel pricing based on market analysis.
	•
Agriculture: ECO Lao Coffee uses AI for smart farming, monitoring crop health, managing irrigation, and predicting 
optimal harvest times.
	•
Tourism: Green Discovery Laos enhances its eco-tourism offerings by using AI to tailor travel experiences based on 
customer preferences and optimize resource use.
	•
Airline Industry: Lao Airlines employs AI for flight scheduling, route planning, and customer service automation.
While AI use cases like the above have emerged in Laos, data on their economic impact remains limited. Across Southeast Asia, 
AI could add $1 trillion to the region’s GDP by 2030, representing an 18 percent increase64. Indonesia, the largest economy 
in ASEAN, is expected to contribute about one-third of this growth, but the extent of AI’s effect on Laos is still uncertain. 
For context, approximately 40 percent of jobs in Singapore are considered highly complementary to AI, compared to just 3 
percent in Laos, showing limited exposure and growth opportunities in productivity65.
AI startups such as laligence.ai have begun to appear66, but remain few and far between. Scaling AI adoption typically 
requires significant resources and support from larger industry players and established companies exploring bigger use 
cases. Investment in startups is also limited in Laos, mainly taking the form of grants rather than traditional venture capital 
commonly seen in other Southeast Asian countries67.
The innovation ecosystem in Laos is still in its very nascent stages, with limited capital and scarce R&D funding posing significant 
barriers to growing sustainable AI business models. While there are some initiatives aimed at fostering entrepreneurship 
and youth innovation, overall resources and infrastructure remain underdeveloped, leaving Laos in the early stages of its AI 
adoption journey.
This challenge was also acknowledged by the Minister of Technology and Communications. As highlighted by the Minister, 
local AI startups face structural barriers including limited domestic demand, scarce early-stage funding, and talent shortages. 
There is an urgent call to create AI innovation centers, reduce reliance on foreign platforms, and embed Lao-developed 
solutions in public procurement to give local entrepreneurs a fair competitive edge.

Based on data pulled and analyzed from 108jobs68, a local job portal, ICT and ICT-adjacent roles such as Data Analyst, Product 
Manager, and Solution Officer account for an average of 5% of all job listings each month. However, there is no official data 
on the number of Laotians currently employed in specialized ICT roles such as Data Scientist or AI Engineer. A statement by 
the Minister of Technology and Communications estimates that approximately 1% of the national workforce69, or around 
35,000 people, are employed in the ICT sector. In follow-up consultations, the Ministry of Labor emphasized that the demand 
for AI-related roles is growing, particularly in areas such as data analysis, cybersecurity, and software engineering. While the 
Ministry currently lacks dedicated initiatives to promote AI upskilling, it acknowledges AI as a critical future competency. 
Officials noted that AI is seen as augmentative rather than fully disruptive, enabling faster, more informed human labor rather 
than replacement. 
An interview with officials from the Ministry of Labor reveals that a master plan to develop a labor market information system 
that integrates AI in job market analysis has been proposed. This initiative is an essential first step as there is currently no clear 
mechanism to anticipate labor shifts driven by automation, nor is there an official database tracking AI-relevant job roles.
To complement our research, we’ve conducted a readiness survey that included manpower planning plans from numerous 
ICT stakeholders in Laos (will be explained further in the second chapter). The survey indicates that among the respondents, 
90.2% of organizations with digital transformation initiatives plan to hire employees with AI or advanced IT skills, with ‘software 
engineer’ (19%) and ‘cybersecurity analyst’ (16.5%) being the most in-demand job title.
INVESTMENTS 
Laos faces challenges in attracting and retaining foreign investment in the information and communication technology 
(ICT) sector due to its relatively small consumer base. Knowledge-intensive industries, including software development 
and IT services, constitute only a minor share of foreign direct investment (FDI), limiting the country’s ability to develop a 
robust digital economy.
To address this, the Ministry of Planning and Investment has actively promoted high-tech investment opportunities through 
dedicated initiatives and online platforms. However, investment inflows have still largely concentrated on extractive industries: 
over the past decade, FDI has been predominantly driven by the exploitation of natural resources, particularly in the mining 
of gold, silver, copper, iron, and bauxite, as well as the expansion of hydropower projects (Laos has publicly pushed for 
more foreign investment in this hydropower projects, seeking to capitalize their hydropower surplus). These resource-
based investments have catalyzed infrastructure development and energy-related projects, creating additional avenues for 
foreign investment.
Domestic investment in digital infrastructure and e-government initiatives in Laos remains limited, primarily due to financial 
constraints and a reliance on government-led funding. A recent report by the United Nations Department of Economic 
and Social Affairs (UN DESA) highlights a critical gap in budget allocation for the maintenance of e-government systems70. 
The absence of a dedicated budget for system upkeep prevents government agencies from securing state funding to support 
ongoing maintenance and upgrades. As a result, e-government platforms risk becoming unsustainable, undermining efforts 
to enhance digital governance, public service delivery, and administrative efficiency.

73	 Global Innovation Index 2023 
Laos’s startup ecosystem is beginning to develop. Encouraging trends in local entrepreneurship offer a foundation for 
expanded support to Lao-based startups and digital services. One example being Loca, a ride-hailing service, garnered 
significant media attention as a startup71, and some other digital platforms have crawled their way to public consumption. 
However, foreign digital products are still prevalent in the market. A study by UN ESCAP in 2024 showed that there is a 
very limited market share of local e-commerces (less than single digit) with most e-commerce traffic going to Chinese 
e-commerce companies72.
Despite the slow development of e-commerce in Laos, many Lao people navigate its complexity by using intermediaries 
to facilitate cross-border shipping to purchase goods from other countries. For example, many buyers have found ways to 
purchase and receive products from Thai e-commerce platforms like Shopee and Lazada, which do not typically deliver 
to Laos.
OUTPUTS - TECHNOLOGICAL EXPORTS AND INNOVATION
Laos has shown slight improvement in the Global Innovation Index (GII), ranking 112th out of 132 economies in 2022 and 
110th in 2023, with an innovation index score of 17.80 points in 2024 (see figure 10). The country performs better in innovation 
inputs than outputs, ranking 98th in inputs and 122nd in outputs in 2022, and 100th in inputs and 120th in outputs in 2023. 
This indicates that Laos invests in innovation but struggles to generate corresponding outputs. Key strengths in 2023 included 
a low applied tariff rate (ranked 11th), strong FDI inflows (22nd), and creative goods exports (36th), while its weakest area remains 
knowledge and technology outputs.

Laos’ high-tech exports have fluctuated, with exports totaling approximately $223 million in 2021, marking a 5.4% decline 
from the previous year. Estimates on high-tech exports vary, with one source stating they accounted for 2.98% of total exports, 
while another reported $109.84 million in exports. These figures highlight the country’s ongoing challenges in scaling its 
high-tech industry despite investments in innovation. Addressing the gap between inputs and outputs, particularly in 
knowledge and technology sectors, could enhance Laos’ innovation-driven growth73.

In this section, infrastructural and technical dimensions will be discussed. The technical and infrastructure dimensions refer to 
the installed capacity within countries for the development and deployment of AI solutions, whether through their computing 
power, the availability of data centers, connectivity, and internet access, among others. These elements are relevant enablers 
for the development of AI systems within a country, as they determine development capabilities based on the infrastructure 
available and necessary to support processed information.
INFRASTRUCTURE AND CONNECTIVITY
Laos faces significant challenges in its technology infrastructure and digital connectivity compared to its Southeast Asian 
(SEA) counterparts. With a mobile telephone subscription rate of 64.91%, the country has the lowest penetration in the region. 
Additionally, the share of the population with a fixed broadband telephone subscription is minimal, at just 2%, while fixed 
telephone subscriptions stand at 17%. A mere 0.06% of the population subscribes to bundled broadband and telephone 
services, further highlighting the country’s digital divide. Mobile broadband access remains limited, with only 56.43% of the 
population actively subscribing, positioning Laos just above Timor-Leste in the SEA region74. 
The country’s average international bandwidth capacity is 121,000 Mbit/s, the lowest in the region, further constraining 
digital connectivity. The average fixed broadband download speed of 40.09 Mbps is one of the slowest among neighboring 
countries, though it surpasses the speeds available in Indonesia and Myanmar.
Connectivity and coverage also remains a significant barrier: Laos has the lowest minimum 3G mobile network coverage 
in Southeast Asia, reaching only 85% of the population. 4G coverage is slightly lower at 76%75, while 5G is still in its infancy, 
available through a single telecom provider in just 28 locations76. This limited internet infrastructure poses a serious constraint 
on the adoption of internet-based AI services. Lower-generation networks lack the bandwidth and speed necessary to support 
more demanding applications, such as real-time multimodal AI interactions, which require fast and stable connections to 
function effectively.
Despite these limitations, 66.2% of the Lao population use the internet, ranking above Cambodia (56.7%) and Timor-Leste 
(40.8%). Universal access to electricity has also been achieved, ensuring that digital connectivity initiatives can be pursued 
without significant energy access barriers. 
APPLIED STANDARDS
Laos’ involvement in international AI and digital technology standardization processes, such as ISO/IEC and IEEE 7000, remains 
unclear. The Department of Standardization and Metrology (DOSM), formerly under the Ministry of Science and Technology 
is an ISO member77 that is designated by the government to be the main governing body for standardization in Laos.

81	 Law on Statistics (2017) (Amended) 
Laos has limited computing infrastructure, with only two data centers operating in the country, representing approximately 
0.000026% per capita, a relatively low number in the SEA region78. Although colocation data center statistics per million 
population are unavailable, the presence of at least two data centers offers a foundation for future expansion in cloud 
computing and digital services.
While the country has established policies governing cloud computing under its Telecommunications Law, these policies 
do not specifically address AI-driven cloud services. The law primarily focuses on the development of information systems, 
with no explicit regulatory framework for AI-based cloud computing. Furthermore, no formal assessment has been conducted 
to evaluate the effectiveness of existing cloud computing policies.
STATISTICAL PERFORMANCE AND DATA MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORKS
The statistical performance of the country, as measured by the Statistical Performance Indicators (SPI), stands at 60.9, placing 
the country in the second quintile among global rankings (see figure 11). In terms of data products, Laos scores 63 overall, 
with specific sub-scores of 18 in social statistics, 20 in economic statistics, 9 in environmental statistics, and 16 in institutional 
statistics. The country’s data sources score stands at 44, with censuses contributing 25 points, surveys 10 points, and geospatial 
data 9 points. Data infrastructure standards and methods score 35, indicating areas for improvement in standardization 
and consistency79.

NATIONAL MULTI-STAKEHOLDER 
MAPPING: LAOS’ NASCENT 
ECOSYSTEM IN MOTION
Stakeholders in Laos’ AI ecosystem include ministries, universities, tech companies, the media, civil society actors, 
and international development agencies, each engaging with AI from different starting points. As covered in the previous 
chapter, AI usage, adoption and regulation in the country is still developing and exploratory. This chapter synthesizes their 
roles, concerns, and strategic directions, based on multistakeholder consultations conducted in March 2025 across Vientiane 
and Luang Prabang.
ENGAGEMENT AND DATA COLLECTION PROCESS
To ensure an inclusive, evidence-based mapping of AI stakeholders in Laos, the Ministry of Technology and Communications, 
assisted by the UNESCO team employed a multi-method approach combining immersive stakeholder consultations, survey 
data collection, targeted focus group discussions, and desk research. These efforts helped surface not only institutional 
capabilities and sectoral concerns, but also broader hopes, ethical sensitivities, and strategic outlooks on AI.
To facilitate the entire RAM process, including workshops, surveys, and data collection across multiple agencies, 
the government established a coordination mechanism designed to ensure effective collaboration and broad representation 
of stakeholders from diverse backgrounds. The structure of this coordination mechanism is illustrated in Figure 12.

National Consultative Workshops
The cornerstone of this mapping exercise was a series of national consultative workshops held in Vientiane and Luang 
Prabang in March 2025, convening over 50 representatives from across government, academia, private sector, media, civil 
society, and international organizations. 
Each session was designed to facilitate mutual learning and contextual discussion, moving beyond formal presentations to 
open dialogue. The workshop experience was structured in five progressive phases:
1.	 Briefing on global and regional AI trends, segmented into thematic areas such as:
	•
AI and the workforce
	•
Ethics and governance of AI
	•
Sectoral innovations (e.g., Smart Cities, Agriculture, and Cultural Preservation)
2.	 Stakeholder presentations, where participating organizations shared real-life AI use cases or strategic considerations, 
ranging from language technologies and customer service automation to national strategy development.
3.	 Panel discussion and guided conversation, centered on stakeholders’ readiness, perceived risks, institutional 
bottlenecks, and future AI aspirations.
4.	 Daily synthesis and collaborative summary, where moderators and participants identified key insights, recurring 
themes, and actionable directions.
5.	 Closing reflections, capturing commitments, questions, and the energy to carry discussions forward into policy or 
programmatic action.
The workshops were purposefully immersive and participatory. Notably, stakeholders responded with enthusiasm and 
candor, often highlighting gaps in regulation, coordination, and skills, but also demonstrating a strong collective appetite 
for structured AI engagement and ethical governance.
National AI Readiness Survey
To complement qualitative insights, an AI Readiness Questionnaire was administered to all stakeholder groups represented 
in the workshops. The survey, which gathered 44 complete responses, was designed to gauge:
	•
Existing IT and AI infrastructure in institutions
	•
Frequency and effectiveness of AI use
	•
Awareness of and trust in AI systems
	•
Presence (or absence) of institutional AI/IT policies
	•
Perceptions of AI literacy and training needs
Key survey insights included:
	•
86.4% of respondents reported having dedicated IT/IS units in their institutions.
	•
84.1% used AI tools personally (e.g., ChatGPT, OCR) on a daily or weekly basis, outpacing institutional adoption.
	•
95.5% expressed trust or high confidence in AI systems used in professional contexts.
	•
27.3% of institutions still lack any formal IT or AI policy, and most existing policies focus on general IT governance 
rather than AI-specific concerns.

### Page 49

47
The juxtaposition of high individual use vs. limited organizational readiness underscores one of the most important findings 
of the assessment: AI use is present, but often shallow and unstructured, indicating both promise and urgency for formal 
strategic development.
Focus Discussions with UN Agencies and Development Partners
The UN, along with its subsidiary organizations and international institutions plays a big role in the digital transformation 
agenda in Laos as donor and capacity builder. In addition to national actors, the AI readiness team conducted targeted 
focus group discussions with development agencies, including UNESCO, UNDP, WHO, UNICEF, and the local UN-RCO. These 
dialogues served multiple purposes:
	•
To understand the alignment between international digital programs and Laos’ emerging AI agenda
	•
To explore sustainability concerns regarding externally seeded initiatives
	•
To identify cross-sector opportunities for ethical AI collaboration, particularly in education, healthcare, public 
governance, and youth engagement
Participants emphasized the importance of local ownership, continuity mechanisms, and policy integration for AI-related 
programming. Several UN bodies highlighted the risk of “pilot fatigue”, short-term innovation without institutional anchoring, 
and reiterated their readiness to support capacity-building and ethical governance frameworks.
National Final Insights and Recommendations Workshop
To ensure that the Lao PDR National AI Readiness Assessment Methodology (RAM) captured both technical accuracy 
and contextual realities, our team conducted a National Final Insights and Recommendations Validation Workshop at the 
conclusion of our engagement.
Following the national consultative workshops and the gathering of survey data, the expert team prepared a draft of the 
National AI RAM report outlining our preliminary insights and recommendations. This draft was presented to a multi-
stakeholder audience, including representatives from government ministries, media, civil society organizations, industry, 
academia, and international organizations, with the objective of securing feedback, verifying factual accuracy, and enriching 
the evidence base.
The workshop yielded several key refinements to the findings:
	•
Institutional Coordination: Stakeholders advised that establishing a standalone National AI Council may not be the 
most efficient approach, given existing high-level bodies (e.g., National Digital Transformation Committee). Instead, 
AI governance should be embedded within these existing mechanisms to leverage current structures.
	•
Academic Research Approach: Participants acknowledged that bottom-up research initiation is rare in the Lao 
academic environment, where researchers typically seek grants first before developing topics. Recommendations 
were adjusted to recognize this grant-driven dynamic.
	•
Education vs. Public Engagement: Stakeholders stressed the need to treat these as distinct domains in AI literacy 
efforts, with public engagement strategies tailored to Laos’ socio-economic realities, including retention and 
agency challenges.
	•
Incentive Structures for Talent: Scholarship programs should evolve into motivation-based incentives to encourage 
completion, particularly for rural recipients who may face stronger economic pressures to enter the workforce early.

### Page 50

48
	•
Private Sector Awareness of Incentives: While examples of infrastructure development and R&D incentives were 
shared, they were unfamiliar to most industry players, indicating the need for initial awareness-building and active 
communications from the government towards potential incentive mechanisms before adoption.
	•
Open Data Opportunities: Many private sector actors cited difficulty accessing public data for their business 
development purposes. However, participants noted a positive shift and anticipated easier access in the future with 
recent developments in digital transformation by the government.
Feedback from this workshop was systematically integrated into the final report, resulting in sharper, context-sensitive 
recommendations in areas such as institutional coordination, capacity building at provincial levels, data accessibility, 
and industry engagement.
This participatory validation process strengthened the credibility, relevance, and operability of the final recommendations, 
while fostering early buy-in among the actors critical to operationalizing Laos’ AI readiness agenda.
Desk Research and Policy Review
Finally, the team conducted extensive desk research to review:
	•
Laos’ digital transformation strategies and sectoral roadmaps
	•
Existing legal frameworks (e.g., Data Protection Law, Digital Government Decree)
	•
AI-specific initiatives (e.g., draft strategy, research projects, pilots)
	•
International benchmarks and UNESCO RAM indicators
This secondary data helped triangulate workshop and survey findings, while providing necessary context on structural 
barriers such as legal ambiguity, data infrastructure constraints, and urban-rural technology divides.
STAKEHOLDER ROLES AND LANDSCAPE
This section outlines our reading of the actual and expected contribution of each stakeholder group to Laos’ emerging 
AI landscape.
The government, spearheaded by the MTC, has taken a leadership role in steering national AI planning and coordination. 
As mentioned previously, through the Applied Research Institute of Smart Technology (ARIST), MTC has been leading the 
drafting of the National AI Strategy 2025–2035 and facilitating early capacity-building and training programs, such as AI 
certification schemes supported by multi-national companies or regional development institutions. Other ministries have 
contributed sector-specific perspectives by exploring AI for their sector. These efforts reflect the government’s role as both 
policy setter and experimentation enabler.
Academic institutions serve as the essential talent engine of AI readiness in Laos. Examples of such initiatives include 
the initiative NUOL is undertaking in actively revising its computer science curriculum to include data science, machine 
learning, and AI fundamentals. Beyond curriculum development, NUOL collaborates with the industry to offer short-term AI 
training and also supports research on the use of AI in teaching, particularly content generation and adaptive assessments. 
Souphanouvong University (SU) is pursuing smart university status and has ongoing initiatives in smart city research in Luang 
Prabang, including 3D modeling and digital infrastructure planning. While research output remains limited due to funding 
constraints, both universities are playing a critical role in raising AI awareness and building a foundational AI-literate workforce.

### Page 51

The private sector contributes applied innovation, early use cases, and operational learning. Ride hailing companies, Banks, 
Telco, and National Electricity company, and various IT startups have integrated AI into logistics, customer service, fraud 
detection, and internal process automation. These industry actors not only demonstrate the utility of AI in everyday business 
operations, but also collaborate with academic institutions (e.g. through internships, guest lectures, or R&D pilots), thereby 
bridging practice with education.
Media organizations, such as the Lao Journalists Association, have started training initiatives to prepare reporters for 
responsible AI coverage and ethical communication. They play an important intermediary role by translating technical 
developments into public discourse and shaping citizen perception. Training efforts supported by international partners, 
such as the EU, have helped build basic AI literacy within the media sector. AI is also being explored as a content generation 
and editing tool within journalism itself.
Youth groups and civil society organizations act as fast-moving adopters, educators, and public influencers. The Lao Youth 
Union and affiliated digital literacy networks have begun experimenting with AI for content creation, outreach campaigns, 
and youth training. These groups are uniquely positioned to build ethical awareness and digital fluency among younger 
generations, particularly given the high mobile device penetration and social media use among youth in Laos. Discussions 
during the workshop highlighted their eagerness to engage in AI education, ethics discourse, and community awareness.
International development partners, including UNESCO, UNDP, WHO, UNICEF, World Bank, and others, contribute technical 
guidance, global benchmarking, and institutional capacity support. They co-organized the national readiness assessments, 
contributed to capacity building efforts, and provided diagnostic tools. In addition, organizations such as JICA, EU, and SEAMEO 
have supported digital infrastructure and cross-border collaboration, including partnerships between Lao institutions and 
regional universities. These partners continue to serve as accelerators of national readiness and champions of inclusive, 
ethical development.
Together, these actors are laying the groundwork for a more connected, locally informed, and inclusive AI ecosystem. Their 
contributions, from curriculum reform and smart city experimentation to AI pilot implementation and policy design, represent 
important steps toward a national AI strategy that is not only technically sound but also socially grounded and future-proofed.

INSIGHT FROM STAKEHOLDERS
84	  News publication regarding Sen. Marco Rubio’s case 
Building on national workshops, survey results, and targeted meetings, several shared concerns and systemic challenges 
emerged from stakeholder discussions, as outlined below:
Shared Concerns and Challenges
Stakeholder consultations and surveys revealed optimism about AI’s potential in Lao PDR, alongside recurring cross-sector 
concerns. While perspectives varied by proximity to policy, technology, or public engagement, a clear pattern emerged: 
stakeholders recognize both AI’s opportunities and the structural barriers to ethical, inclusive adoption.
These concerns reflect a nascent AI landscape, still characterized by experimentation rather than institutionalization, 
highlighting the need for coordinated action, long-term investment, and sustained capacity building. Table 2 summarizes 
the recurring issues identified across the ecosystem.

development, deployment, or oversight. This creates hesitation among both 
public and private actors
2
Capacity and 
talent limitations
While individual familiarity with AI tools (like ChatGPT) is rising, institutional 
knowledge and skilled human resources remain limited, particularly in smaller 
government units and rural academic institutions
3
Fragmentation and lack 
of coordination
Ministries, agencies, and universities are often working in parallel, without a 
common platform to align goals, share data, or pool resources
4
Dependence on foreign 
technologies 
Most AI systems in use are externally developed, with minimal localization (e.g., 
lack of Lao-language datasets). This raises concerns over data sovereignty, bias, 
and ethical alignment
5
Digital divide and 
inclusivity gaps
The rural-urban divide, low digital literacy in some populations, and limited local 
content creation pose challenges to ensuring equitable access to AI benefits
6
Ethical concerns and 
misinformation risks
Particularly among civil society and media stakeholders, there is growing worry 
about the spread of disinformation, surveillance misuse, and the absence of 
safeguards for ethical deployment
7
Awareness of AI-
Enabled threats
Low readiness to combat scams, fraud, and deepfake risks, voice-note culture 
makes Laos particularly vulnerable (e.g. Marco Rubio case of voice deep 
fake cloning84).
8
Over-Regulation Risk
AI development is nascent; overly strict rules could stifle talent and innovation 
room for growth.
9
Ethics in Governance
Concerns exist over whether governing institutions themselves meet the ethical 
and transparency standards they would enforce on AI developers and users. 
Strengthening anti-corruption measures, embedding AI ethics into public sector 
governance, and establishing independent oversight mechanisms are critical to 
ensuring credible and ethical AI governance.

As stated before, a follow-up survey was conducted after the workshops to assess the spread and prioritization of these 
concerns. As shown in Figures 14 and 15, the results indicate that a particularly prominent concern was around intellectual 
property and content ownership, with copyright infringement and plagiarism emerging as the most commonly cited concern 
from all stakeholders.
Closely tied to this is a deep-seated worry about cultural dilution, especially from stakeholders in the media (25%), private 
sector (15%), and government (15%). As Lao society becomes more exposed to AI tools developed abroad, there is concern 
that national identity, language, and traditional knowledge could be eroded or underrepresented.

Another major concern is human capacity and workforce resilience. Around 10% to 14% of respondents in all stakeholder 
groups cited the deterioration of human skills and overdependence on AI as a key concern. This reflects anxieties not only 
about job displacement, but also about the fading of human judgment and critical thinking, particularly if AI tools are adopted 
without adequate training and safeguards. This concern was especially high among media professionals (25%), where human 
storytelling and credibility remain central to their role.

### Page 54

52
While other issues, such as bias and environmental impacts, received less attention overall, the cumulative data paints a clear 
picture: stakeholders in Laos are not only aware of AI’s potential, they are acutely conscious of its risks. 
Stakeholders’ Strategy to Address AI Worries and Challenges
While concerns about AI risks are widespread, stakeholders in Laos are also actively proposing solutions. Stakeholders in 
Government, academia, business, media, and all parties concerned, identified six key areas considered essential for progress 
through our survey and workshops:
1. Strengthening Human Capital through AI Literacy and Training
A consistent message across the ecosystem is that building internal human capacity must come first. Many institutions, 
especially in government and academia, lack the talent, confidence, or common understanding to advance AI responsibly. 
Without basic AI literacy, civil servants hesitate to use AI tools, and  researchers and educators feel they can be left behind 
with their foreign peer’s progress.
This view was reinforced in the AI Readiness Survey, where more than one-third of respondents (35.9%) identified staff training 
and AI education as their top support needs. This sentiment is in alignment with current efforts:
	•
Training for AI literacy for civil servants arranged by ministries (government)
	•
Development and embedding of AI curricula and building partnerships through international partnerships (Universities)
	•
Industry players are experimenting and implementing AI to optimize their operations; this being preceded by AI 
awareness trainings
	•
Media companies having AI literacy sessions to educate them regarding its uses and potential dangers
Strategic importance: Institutionalize AI literacy at all levels, from civil servant upskilling to early 
education, and from media professionals to youth trainers. This strategy should address concerns 
regarding Capacity and talent limitations.
Additional Note: During our engagement with stakeholders on talent development in digital and AI through literacy and 
training efforts, it was discovered that retention surfaced as a key challenge. Many participants exhibited low completion 
rates and disengaged after the initial sessions. A recurring pattern involves trainees relocating to urban centers like Vientiane 
to access these opportunities, only to leave early in pursuit of employment, which often takes priority over completing the 
program. These socioeconomic realities must be acknowledged and factored into the design of future initiatives. Targeted 
incentives that encourage completion and sustain motivation will be critical to the success of such programs.

2. Developing Frameworks for Policy, Regulation, and Incentives of Using AI
The government and the private sector frequently cited the absence of a legal and regulatory foundation as both a barrier 
and a risk. Without clear guidance on procurement, liability, content use, or data governance, institutions are unsure how 
far they can go. Many called for the development of national AI principles or interim governance guidance to shape pilots 
and public trust.
This concern came through in the survey as well: 9% of respondents selected policy, regulatory, and incentive frameworks 
as key areas for support, reflecting a desire not just for protection, but also permission to innovate.
With that being said, there have been signals from several stakeholders regarding this theme:
	•
Businesses and academia are awaiting clearer rules on procurement, liability, and data use; thus emphasizing the 
importance of government’s pace and adaptiveness in regulating AI in the country
	•
Ministries acknowledge the lack of a unified regulatory framework and are considering implementing sandbox-
style pilots.
	•
The acknowledgement to establish an ethics board or advisory committee regarding AI implementation.
	•
In developing policy frameworks, there have been mentions of algorithmic transparency reviews and risk classification 
for AI systems.
Strategic importance: Provide ad hoc guidance or directions to inquirers while the national strategy 
is finalized. Include ethical principles, transparency requirements, and accountability mechanisms.
3. Fostering Cross-collaboration and Ecosystem Building
Many stakeholders emphasized that no single actor can build AI readiness alone. Collaboration between academia, industry, 
media, and government was viewed not as a bonus, but a necessity. Several stakeholders cited existing informal partnerships, 
but called for more structured forums or mechanisms to align efforts, avoid duplication, and share lessons.

### Page 56

54
The survey backs this up, with 15.4% of respondents selecting ecosystem collaboration as a critical support need, especially 
those in universities and media, who are keen to engage more with private sector expertise and policy circles. Signals for 
this strategy to be taken are as follows:
	•
Universities has been collaborating with industry giants to open short courses on AI, educating its lecturers, 
and competitions to upskill academia
	•
Ministries have begun convening multi-stakeholder workshops, with participation from youth, media, academia, 
and business.
	•
International organizations are facilitating dialogues that model inclusive governance and shared accountability.
Strategic importance: A successful AI ecosystem must be co-created. Establishing a national AI 
coordination body or consortium, inclusive of public, private, academic, and civic actors, could help 
align priorities, share resources, and avoid siloed development.
4. Unlocking Access to Funding and Incentives for Innovation
The lack of financial support for infrastructure, training, or experimentation remains a major barrier across sectors. Stakeholders 
described promising ideas that couldn’t take off due to funding constraints. Startups struggle to trial AI applications; 
universities can’t afford to retain skilled faculty; civil society groups lack means to pilot AI for public interest.
This reality was reflected in the survey, where 24.4% of respondents selected increased funding or government subsidy as a 
critical support need. Based on the immersive sessions, the signals that point to this strategy are:
	•
Some ministries are considering linking AI readiness to broader digital transformation and innovation budgets.
	•
Private sector actors expressed interest in co-investing in joint initiatives if public match funding or tax incentives 
are available.
	•
Universities are actively applying for donor grants to develop infrastructure and faculty capacity.
Strategic importance: Funding and monetary support is essential for any tech developments, it must 
also be balanced with the risk of having weak investments. Thus piloting on a smaller scale, with a 
scaling up strategy in mind can be implemented.
5. Investing in Local Infrastructure and Language Tools
Stakeholders across government, academia, and media raised concerns about the lack of local datasets, language processing 
tools, and infrastructure to support responsible AI use. Without basic digital foundations including Lao-language data, 
institutions cannot build, test, or deploy AI in contextually meaningful ways. Discussion in the workshop reveals that:
	•
Government and academic institutions are beginning to digitize paper records and archive datasets.
	•
Some actors have expressed interest in developing Lao-language natural language processing (NLP) tools (such as 
contributing to crowd-sourcing datasets like SEA-crowd).
	•
Stakeholders voiced support for shared repositories or national data platforms to support open innovation.
Strategic importance: Strengthening local data ecosystems and infrastructure is critical for 
enabling context-appropriate AI solutions in Laos. Without Lao-language datasets and foundational 
infrastructure, AI systems risk being irrelevant, inaccurate, or biased. Investing early in localized 
data resources will not only accelerate domestic AI innovation but also ensure that applications are 
culturally and linguistically aligned, fostering trust and adoption.

Hopes and Expectations for AI Development in Laos
Stakeholders are looking to each other for guidance and support. Consultations and surveys revealed forward-looking 
expectations about the roles different actors should play in building a responsible, inclusive, and sustainable AI ecosystem.
These expectations reflect a shared understanding that successful AI adoption is a collective effort: governance from 
government, capacity from academia, innovation from industry, public literacy from media and civil society, and support 
from international partners. The following synthesis of hopes and expectations were drawn from immersive workshops and 
national survey results.
1. Expectations Toward Government Institutions
Across all sectors, there is a strong call for the government to lead the national AI agenda, not by controlling all aspects, 
but by providing the strategic direction, legal clarity, and institutional scaffolding that others need to act confidently. There 
is a shared belief that the government should not only regulate AI, but also empower and convene all stakeholders to set 
the rules of the game and make space for others to contribute. These are summarized into several themes:
	•
Clear policy and legal frameworks: Stakeholders want comprehensive AI regulations, including rules on data use, 
ethical AI standards, and legal liability for misuse. Businesses and academia, in particular, emphasize the need for 
official guidelines to avoid paralysis or missteps.
	•
Strategic leadership and vision: There is widespread hope for a national AI strategy that outlines sectoral priorities 
(e.g., agriculture, education), provides performance benchmarks, and articulates a long-term vision.
	•
Funding and support mechanisms: Many institutions expect the government to allocate budget toward AI 
infrastructure, R&D, and training; to create incentives for innovation in the private sector.
	•
Data stewardship and access: Especially from industry and academia, there are calls for the government to open up 
relevant datasets and establish mechanisms for secure, equitable data access.
2. Expectations Toward Academic Institutions
All sectors look to academia as the engine of human capital, not only to produce AI developers, but also to lead on ethics, 
public understanding, and long-term innovation through research and experimentation. Thus highlighting the hopes of 
stakeholders that academic institutions act as educator, innovator, and supporter whenever piloting projects are to be done. 
These expectations are explained as the following themes:
	•
Curriculum development and AI integration: There is strong demand for universities and schools to integrate AI 
into curricula, from primary-level digital literacy to university-level specializations. Businesses, in particular, hope for 
hands-on learning that equips students with practical skills.
	•
Training for non-technical audiences: Stakeholders expect academia to offer short courses and workshops for civil 
servants, media professionals, and business leaders, helping bridge the knowledge gap across sectors.
	•
Research and applied innovation: Government agencies and companies alike want universities to conduct localized 
research and co-create AI use cases relevant to Lao PDR’s needs.
	•
Institutional collaboration: Academic institutions are expected to collaborate not just with one another, but also 
across sectors in co-developing policy advice, AI tools, and community outreach initiatives.
3. Expectations Toward Businesses and Industry
Industry stakeholders, especially those already experimenting with AI are seen as essential for translating AI into real-world 
value. Other sectors, especially government and academia, look to businesses to test, demonstrate, and scale AI innovations. 
More vividly, stakeholders are hoping that Industry will be the ones to shape the perception of people regarding what good 
AI implementation looks like in the Lao context based on trials and success stories in company usage. The following are 
themes of expectations for businesses and industry:

### Page 58

56
	•
Developing local AI applications: Businesses are expected to prototype solutions tailored to Lao realities such as 
smart city services, AI for agriculture, and customer service automation.
	•
Investing in R&D and workforce development: Both internal expectations and external ones call on businesses to 
invest in training employees, building internal AI teams, and contributing to national innovation goals.
	•
Collaborating with academia and government: Stakeholders hope to see industry co-create use cases with 
universities, participate in policy discussions, and contribute to national platforms for knowledge-sharing.
	•
Driving digital transformation: Businesses are also expected to lead by example in transforming their own operations, 
showing other sectors what responsible AI adoption looks like in practice.
4. Expectations Toward Media and Civil Society
Media and civil society organizations are viewed as essential for ensuring that AI development does not become elitist or 
opaque, but instead remains accessible, inclusive, and grounded to be accessible for many layers of the citizen, across gender 
and location. While there are many expectations on media and CSOs to be the watchdogs of AI implementation and usage, 
there are also high expectations for them to bridge the knowledge gap between layers of society. Here are the main themes 
of expectations towards media and civil society organizations:
	•
Promoting AI literacy and public awareness: Nearly all stakeholder groups expect CSOs and media to explain AI to 
the public, highlighting both benefits and risks in relatable ways.
	•
Guarding against misinformation: There is hope that the media can use and report on AI responsibly, and help 
people distinguish between legitimate tools and manipulated or fake content.
	•
Championing AI ethics and equity: Civil society is expected to raise questions of fairness, access, and impact, 
to amplify the voices of groups who might otherwise be left out of AI conversations.
	•
Engaging creatively with AI tools: Some stakeholders encouraged CSOs and journalists to explore AI for storytelling, 
education, and even tourism promotion; helping make AI visible and relevant to everyday life.
5. Expectations Toward International Organizations
While Lao PDR’s AI journey must be locally led, stakeholders are acutely aware of the importance of international engagement, 
for knowledge exchange, funding, and alignment with global standards. Consequently, international organizations do 
contribute and uplift Laos’ AI development; however, stakeholders point out that sovereignty of development capacity must 
still be upheld. More closely, the following are main themes of expectations of stakeholders towards international organizations:
	•
Capacity development and training: Across sectors, there are requests for international partners to support human 
resource development, including scholarships, technical training, and expert exchange programs.
	•
Funding and infrastructure support: Stakeholders hope that development partners will help fund local AI initiatives, 
including the creation of a national language model and open infrastructure for research and experimentation.
	•
Policy guidance and global standards: Many institutions, especially in government, look to international bodies for 
ethical frameworks, such as the Hiroshima AI Code of Conduct or UNESCO RAM, to inform Laos’ own governance.
	•
Partnerships over delivery: Increasingly, stakeholders want partnerships that are co-created and long-term, not short-
term project delivery; emphasizing ownership and sustainability.

RECOMMENDATIONS
This section outlines regulatory, institutional, and capacity‑building actions that the Government of the Lao People’s 
Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) and its partners can take to ensure that AI is developed and used in ways that are responsible 
and ethical, based on our findings through the RAM indicators and our engagements with stakeholders
REGULATIONS
Introduce an AI Regulation that Covers Gaps and signifies both Global Consensus and Local Values 
The government should complement existing laws with dedicated AI regulation that addresses current legal gaps while 
reflecting both global best practices and national values. Key areas to be covered include:
1.	 Clear redress mechanisms for harms caused by AI technologies and clear assignment of accountability;
2.	 Public inquiry processes for the deployment of mass-market and public-facing AI systems;
3.	 Certification standards and procurement procedures for AI vendors, particularly for public-sector use;
4.	 Audit access provisions to allow oversight authorities to review AI systems.
In parallel, the government should clearly articulate the ethical values expected in AI development and deployment. 
A practical approach is to integrate the principles of the 2021 UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial 
Intelligence: proportionality and do no harm; safety and security; right to privacy and data protection; multistakeholder 
and adaptive governance and collaboration; responsibility and  accountability; transparency and explainability; human 
oversight and determination sustainability; awareness and literacy; fairness and non-discrimination, into the legislative 
framework. These values need not be binding and could take the form of national guidance or relevant sectoral frameworks. 
This would encourage stakeholders to internalize the principles and promote responsible innovation, even without legally 
binding legislation.
Recommended actors: Ministry of Technology and Communication, the Cabinet Office
Embed Universal Service, Digital Infrastructure Building and Connectivity Obligations into Big Projects and Investments
Laos faces a significant rural-urban divide in digital infrastructure, which threatens to exclude large parts of the population 
from AI-driven benefits. Moreover, given Laos currently has only two operational data centers, co-locating new ones along 
energy corridors presents a cost-effective opportunity. To address this, the government can embed universal service and 
broadband connectivity obligations into major infrastructure projects, particularly in sectors like energy, telecommunications, 
and mining. These obligations should be supported by regulatory and financial incentives to make rural expansion viable for 
private investors. It is important to note that many industry representatives were unfamiliar with government-led infrastructure 
and R&D incentive mechanisms. Consequently, it is identified that an initial awareness-building phase to expose companies 
to available schemes, coupled with targeted incentives, such as tax breaks, matching grants, and regulatory advantages, 
are needed to stimulate AI adoption and private-sector R&D.
Incentive mechanisms that can be implemented:

### Page 60

58
	•
Offer corporate tax holidays or accelerated depreciation for rural broadband deployment.
	•
Grant exclusive rights or extended licenses to companies that meet rural coverage targets.
	•
Provide priority access to public land or utility corridors to reduce deployment costs.
	•
Introduce co-funding or risk-sharing schemes to lower investment risk in underserved areas.
	•
Bundle broadband rollout with hydropower or grid expansion projects, e.g. laying fiber along transmission lines or 
co-locating rural data centers.
	•
Collaborate with the Ministry of Energy and Mines to embed broadband rollout requirements in new hydropower and 
mining concessions, offering regulatory incentives such as extended operational licenses or concession terms in return
Embedding these mechanisms into regulation will ensure that infrastructure development is not only efficient, but also 
inclusive; enabling a more equitable digital transformation that reaches all communities, not just urban centers. All of which 
should be preceded by a proper introduction of mechanisms by the government.
Recommended actors: Telco companies, Electricité du Laos (EDL), Ministry of Technology and Communications, Ministry of 
Finance, Ministry of Planning and Investments, Ministry of Energy and Mines
Incentivize Companies Developing AI Capabilities and Talents
Support companies that are integrating AI into their operations and investing in employee upskilling by offering targeted 
incentives such as tax breaks or grants. Encourage collaboration between industry and academia through matching funds 
for joint initiatives, fostering the growth of AI capabilities across both sectors. This approach will help build a robust AI talent 
pipeline while accelerating the adoption of AI technologies in the economy.
Recommended actors: Ministry of Labor, Ministry of Technology and Communications, Ministry of Education and Sports
Facilitate Public–private Innovation Programmes and Pilot Sandboxes in Key Industries 
Support collaborative innovation by launching public-private programs and pilot sandboxes focused on high-impact sectors. 
Provide tax incentives, matching grants, and challenge funds to encourage the development of AI-driven solutions in areas 
such as public service delivery, smart agriculture (a critical sector employing much of Laos’s workforce), smart tourism, 
and other key industries essential to the national economy. These pilot sandboxes should serve both as testing grounds for 
innovation and as platforms to raise public awareness and attract further investment.
Recommended actors: Ministry of Investment and Planning, Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Ministry of Technology 
and Communications
INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK
Establish a Coordinating Mechanism for the Stakeholders of AI
To reduce siloed efforts and enhance coordination in AI initiatives, many of which require cross-sectoral collaboration, 
a dedicated coordinating mechanism should be established to engage the diverse stakeholders of AI. This mechanism should 
include representatives from government ministries, academia, the private sector, and all parties concerned to collectively 
shape the future of AI in Laos. Its core responsibilities would include overseeing the implementation of the national AI 
strategy, harmonizing AI-related regulations, fostering multi-sector collaboration, and ensuring compliance with ethical 
standards. The government can build on the existing National Committee for Digital Transformation, which already brings

### Page 61

59
together ministries and agencies with structural representation on digital and computing matters, by extending its mandate 
to coordinate AI-related affairs. This would allow AI governance to be embedded into an established national coordination 
mechanism, avoiding duplication and ensuring alignment with broader digital transformation priorities.
Recommended actor: National Committee for Digital Transformation
Setup Cross-disciplinary AI Research Centers in Universities 
Launch cross-disciplinary research centers within universities to foster collaboration and intellectual exchange between 
traditionally siloed departments, such as joint AI ethics centers bridging philosophy and computer science faculties. These 
centers can serve as a foundation for developing multidisciplinary academic programs and co-taught courses. Beyond 
strengthening academic collaboration, they can play a central role in advancing the national AI strategy by driving research 
output and contributing to key publishing targets. To ensure these centers thrive within the existing top-down, grant driven 
nature research culture where researchers typically seek funding before developing research topics, it is crucial to actively 
engage donors and align their funding priorities with the goal of fostering collaboration, like pushing them to start cross-
disciplinary AI research centers within universities. Encouraging donors to support cross-disciplinary initiatives can help shift 
incentives away from fragmented agendas toward more integrated and strategic research efforts.
Recommended actors: Public Universities in Laos, Ministry of Technology and Communications, International Organizations, 
and possible partnerships with foreign universities
CAPACITY BUILDING
Scale AI Literacy and Ethics Education 
Actively engage media organizations, artists, and the broader education ecosystem to cultivate an AI-literate society. In order 
to do this, our discussions with stakeholders suggest splitting AI foundational and public literacy of AI activities into separate 
focus areas. This means continuing current efforts to integrate foundational knowledge of AI, including ethical decision-
making, into national school curricula, civil service training programs, and journalism education. At the same time, to ensure 
inclusivity and broad public understanding, other stakeholders outside the school ecosystem should develop and widely 
disseminate a Lao-language AI primer tailored for the general public, minding socio-economic realities and using culturally 
relevant narratives and accessible formats - this can be done by government institutions, businesses, media networks and/
or civil society organization in context to their industry and vertical. This multi-sectoral approach will build critical awareness, 
empower informed participation, and promote responsible AI use across all levels of society. 
Recommended actors: Ministry of Education and Sports, Schools, Universities, Media organizations, Journalist Unions, Ministry 
of Information, Culture and Tourism, Ministry of Technology and Communications
Launch a Context-aware AI Talent Inclusion Scholarship
Design and implement targeted financial aid programs, scholarships, and structured mentorship pathways to support 
students from rural areas and underrepresented communities in accessing education in AI and data science. To address 
persistent retention challenges such as the need to relocate to urban centers and the pressure to prioritize immediate 
employment, these initiatives should incorporate living stipends, flexible learning formats, and motivational incentives tied 
to program completion. A model inspired by Indonesia’s Kartu Prakerja could be adopted, offering financial handouts or 
digital credit upon successful completion of training phases. In parallel, bonding schemes can provide both financial security 
and a sense of purpose, encouraging participants to focus on completing the program and commit to applying their skills 
in public service for a defined period, particularly in critical sectors such as education, healthcare, and digital governance. 
This integrated approach advances equity in access to emerging technologies while building long-term national capacity 
through the meaningful inclusion of diverse talent.

Strengthening Lao Language Digital Assets and Learning Resources
Limited content in the Lao language remains a major barrier to both AI dataset development and the effective learning of 
digital skills. To address this, the government should invest in crowdsourced initiatives and academic research focused on 
expanding Lao-language corpora, online media content, speech recognition models, and other locally relevant datasets. 
In parallel, it also is critical to develop Lao-language learning resources for digital skills, such as foundational IT, data literacy, 
and AI awareness, so that rural and non-English-speaking populations are not left behind in the digital transition.
Outputs from these efforts should feed into a national Data Commons and be made available under open licenses to 
encourage reuse, transparency, and innovation. Universities can play a key role by aligning student thesis work with these 
national digital asset-building priorities, offering a low-risk, high-impact channel for local capacity development. Laos can 
also leverage its cultural and linguistic proximity to countries like Thailand by forming partnerships with regional institutions 
that have made progress in this area. These collaborations can help accelerate progress through shared resources, proven 
models, and contextual alignment in Southeast Asian language technologies.

Culture and Tourism, Ministry of Technology and Communications
CLARIFICATION OF ROLES FOR SUBNATIONAL AUTHORITIES
Local authority, particularly provincial and municipal authorities play a vital role in bringing AI innovation closer to citizens. 
As the frontline of service delivery and public engagement, they are essential actors in scaling AI solutions that are contextually 
grounded, inclusive, and responsive to local needs.
Strategic Engagement Areas:
	•
Digital Capacity Building for Provincial Authorities
National ministries should invest in systematic upskilling for provincial departments, moving beyond ad-hoc workshops 
toward institutionalized training. While national ministries average a digital maturity score of 1.8/5, provinces lag 
behind at 1.3/5, indicating a capacity gap between central and provincial government
	•
Localized Awareness and Dissemination
Subnational governments are best placed to lead public engagement and AI literacy campaigns at the community 
level. Given the rural digital literacy gap, tailored programs in provinces can close awareness divides and build trust. 
Localizing AI strategies also allows governments to address context-specific opportunities and risks more effectively
	•
AI Use in Local Service Delivery
Many leading examples of AI governance globally come from the city level. Successful early examples highlight the 
potential for localized AI deployment. These use cases can be piloted in agriculture, smart cities and tourism, waste 
management, and e-government services
	•
Data Management and Governance at Subnational Levels
Strengthening data generation and stewardship at the local level is vital. Local authority are key contributors to open 
data ecosystems and must be empowered with tools and standards for structured, secure, and usable data collection. 
This also supports AI use cases grounded in local socio-cultural and economic contexts.

### Page 63

61
Therefore, establishing a formal mechanism within the National AI Council to engage subnational governments through 
co-design workshops, pilot programs, and localized funding schemes. This ensures that the AI transformation is not only 
nationally directed but also locally empowered and equitably distributed.
Recommended actors: Provincial governments, Municipalities, National AI Council, Media, all parties concerned.

PHASING OF RECOMMENDATIONS
These recommendations can be implemented in a phased approach: Foundation, Demonstration, and Institutionalisation, 
ensuring each recommendation point can synergize with one another and leaving room for proper measurement and 
evaluation (see figure 17). 
1.	 Foundation Phase: Focus on laying the groundwork for AI readiness, including setting up regulations, establishing 
institutional bodies (e.g., AI council under National Digital Transformation Council), and launching public awareness 
campaigns. Infrastructure and digital inclusion quick wins should also begin here.
2.	 Demonstration Phase: Implement regulatory sandboxes, pilot AI applications in sectors such as agriculture, education, 
and public services through public private partnership, and roll out research programs. Continue the previous 
awareness campaigns, synergize with the pilot, and scale up. This phase should also test AI impact assessment 
protocols set up in the foundation phase and involve civil society in monitoring and feedback loops. 
3.	 Institutionalisation Phase: Mainstream successful pilots into national frameworks and leverage it to attract long-
term infrastructure investments, formalise long-term funding mechanisms (e.g., for AI scholarships and research), 
institutionalise AI standards, and integrate AI governance into routine inter-ministerial operations.
