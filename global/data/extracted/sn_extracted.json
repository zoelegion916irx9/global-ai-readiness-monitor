  "executive_summary": "Senegal's AI readiness assessment demonstrates that the country has a relatively advanced position in West Africa for AI development, while significant challenges remain across all dimensions.\n\nThe legal and regulatory framework includes data protection legislation and digital governance policies, but specific AI regulations are still lacking. The Emerging Senegal Plan (PSE) provides a strategic framework that can integrate AI development priorities.\n\nRegarding the social and cultural dimension, Senegal has a growing digital culture, particularly among youth, but the gender digital divide remains significant. Public awareness of AI is primarily concentrated in urban areas, necessitating broader sensitization efforts. The country's linguistic and cultural diversity presents both opportunities and challenges for AI development.\n\nThe scientific and educational landscape shows emerging AI research capacity in universities and research institutions, though substantial investment is needed in STEM education and specialized AI training programs.\n\nEconomically, Senegal's digital ecosystem is growing, driven by mobile services and fintech innovation. The startup ecosystem is relatively vibrant, with emerging AI-focused companies. Agriculture and key economic sectors present significant opportunities for AI-driven improvements.\n\nThe technological and infrastructural assessment reveals relatively good telecommunications infrastructure for the region, with expanding broadband coverage. However, computing infrastructure, data availability, and electricity reliability need improvement.\n\nFifty-six recommendations are proposed across all dimensions, emphasizing open data governance, infrastructure investment, education, research, ethical frameworks, and inclusive AI development.",
