  "executive_summary": "Chad's AI readiness assessment, conducted with UNESCO support, reveals that the country is at a very early stage of AI development and adoption. The assessment covers five key dimensions: legal/regulatory, social/cultural, scientific/educational, economic, and technological/infrastructural.\n\nThe legal framework does not yet include specific provisions for AI governance, though existing laws on digital regulation and data protection provide a partial foundation. The social and cultural dimension highlights significant challenges including limited digital literacy, gender gaps in technology access, and low public awareness of AI technologies.\n\nIn the scientific and educational sphere, Chad faces considerable challenges with limited research infrastructure, few AI-specialized programs, and a need for substantial investment in STEM education. The economic dimension reveals a nascent digital economy with minimal AI adoption in the private sector.\n\nThe technological and infrastructural assessment shows significant gaps in connectivity, computing infrastructure, and data availability. However, the government's commitment to digital transformation and adherence to UNESCO's Recommendation on AI Ethics provides a foundation for future development.\n\nThe committee recommends establishing a comprehensive normative framework for AI, strengthening digital infrastructure, investing in education and human capital development, promoting international cooperation, and ensuring inclusive and ethical AI deployment.",
