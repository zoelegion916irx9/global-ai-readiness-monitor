The world is now set to change at a pace not seen in decades, even \ncenturies. AI-based tools and applications make our lives easier, smoother, and richer. They help us move efficiently, get informed, \nget credit, get a job, and get our taxes done. \n \n \nBut in its current form, AI reproduces and amplifies many of the social challenges we face. It is not acceptable that around a third of \nthe world’s population still lacks adequate internet access. Upstream, the AI industry is highly concentrated, with just two \ncountries – the United States and China – and a dozen companies accounting for a major share of the sector. This can lead only \nto greater inequality of outcomes – including gender disparities – downstream. Non-diverse AI teams, unrepresentative datasets, and \nopaque and biased algorithms can cause harm, particularly to those who are already vulnerable, whether companies or \nindividuals, children and young people, women, or entire democracies. \n \n \nThat is why UNESCO drafted the Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, which was adopted in 2021 by 193 \ncountries to make sure AI delivers fair, sustainable, and inclusive outcomes. The Recommendation is based on the protection \nand promotion of human rights, human dignity, and environmental sustainability, and these values are then translated into \nprinciples such as accountability, transparency, and privacy. The Recommendation also sets out concrete policy actions that \ngovernments c",

The country’s strategic policy recommendations and supporting actions encompass crucial aspects such as regulation, creation of an enabling institutional and organisational framework, and capacity building initiatives, all directed at addressing the multifaceted challenges and opportunities presented by the burgeoning use and rapid spread of AI technology. The regulatory framework outlined emphasises the development of policies that prioritise ethical and responsible data systems and processing. Some of the existing Acts, such as POPIA and PEPUDA, uphold and emphasise rights-based protections and ethical AI practices, along with establishing cybersecurity standards and legal safeguards for high-risk AI applications. This reflects an intentional and holistic approach to governance of AI use and application. Additionally, the creation of oversight and implementation mechanisms ensures a robust regulatory environment, fostering trust and accountability in the AI ecosystem. The existence of a functional policy and institutional framework underscores the importance of an independent regulator for AI or the assignment of AI officers within existing institutions, such as the Information Regulator. This collaborative approach across regulators, institutions, and organs aims to enhance the overall effectiveness of responsible AI practices. The emphasis on capacity building, including measures to enable and safeguard AI use in the public sector, highlights a commitment to developing expertise and fostering responsible AI practices at every level. The emphasis on gender inclusivity in AI leadership and involveme",
