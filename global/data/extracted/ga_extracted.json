  "executive_summary": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nFollowing the adoption of the Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, UNESCO has provided support to various Member States, including Gabon, in the process of assessing AI readiness. In response, the government, with UNESCO's support, established the National Technical Committee for AI (CTN-IA). Composed of members from ministries directly involved in AI issues, this committee carried out preparatory work for the implementation of the assessment process.\n\nThe assessment reveals that the implementation of AI systems in Gabon remains embryonic. While no AI use cases have yet been identified in public administration, there is nonetheless some activity in the private and semi-public sectors, particularly in teaching, research and learning, in the productive sector, and in individual usage through various tools, including social networks that have integrated AI into their programming.\n\nThese early stages of AI usage require measures to be taken to enable AI development.\n\nFrom a legal perspective, a framework exists, often linked to digital technology. Not directly related to AI, this legal framework capable of governing the ethical deployment of AI would benefit from evolving to address the challenges raised by AI.\n\nThe social/cultural dimension reveals a small gender gap in internet access in Gabon. While no provisions exist to reduce the digital gender gap, there are provisions aimed at reducing the socio-economic digital gap and the gap between rural and urban areas. Private and semi-public initiatives are also noteworthy, aimed at increasing diversity in the AI sector. Regarding public engagement and trust in digital technology, while it still needs significant improvement, it has noticeably increased over the past two decades. However, significant efforts remain to improve the ethical deployment of AI in the environment, culture, health, and social well-being.\n\nFor the scientific and educational dimension, a proactive policy must be implemented so that research and innovation can benefit from the opportunities offered by AI. The same applies to education, where existing infrastructure and systems do not allow for optimal deployment of AI in this sector.\n\nRegarding the economic dimension, the size and robustness of the AI ecosystem are insignificant. Similarly, the consideration of AI specifics in available statistics is not noticeable.\n\nFinally, the analysis of the technical and infrastructural dimension reveals an acceptable situation regarding infrastructure and good connectivity. Gabon would benefit from being more present in international normative bodies in the ICT sector. Efforts should also be made to strengthen the country's computing capabilities and improve its statistical performance.",
