AI-powered technologies enhance daily life, streamlining processes from accessing information to financial services, \ntransportation, and public administration. Yet, this rapid advancement is not without its challenges.\nThe benefits of AI remain unequally distributed, with significant disparities in access to digital infrastructure and technological \nresources. While some nations lead AI research and innovation, others face barriers that limit their ability to develop or regulate these \ntechnologies effectively. AI systems, if not governed responsibly, can exacerbate societal inequalities, reinforce biases, and challenge \nethical norms. The need for inclusive and ethical AI governance has never been more critical.\nIn response, UNESCO spearheaded the Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, a landmark framework adopted \nin 2021 by 193 countries to ensure AI promotes human rights, dignity, and sustainable development. This global commitment \nunderscores the importance of accountability, transparency, and privacy in AI governance. However, implementing these principles \nrequires robust national frameworks, adaptive policies, and strong institutions.\nThe Readiness Assessment Methodology (RAM) serves as a diagnostic tool to help Member States evaluate their preparedness \nfor ethical AI adoption. By identifying regulatory gaps, technical challenges, and institutional needs, RAM provides a roadmap for \ncountries to navigate AI governance in alignment with the UNESCO Recommendation.\nIn 2024, Curaçao undertook the RAM assessment with support from the UNESCO Office for the Caribbean, engaging diverse \nstakeholders from government ministries, regulatory bodies, academia, civil society, and the private sector. The assessment involved \nconsultations with over 50 participants representing key sectors influencing AI policy and development in the country.\nThis report presents a comprehensive analysis of Curaçao’s AI landscap",

Regulation: Legal and Policy Framework for AI Governance Curaçao must position itself to adopt an AI regulatory framework to govern the ethical and responsible use of AI over time. The first step in this process is the drafting and enactment of a NO on AI, which will set the legal foundation for AI development, deployment, and governance in the country. This legislation will ensure that AI applications in both the public and private sectors adhere to ethical principles, fairness, and non-discrimination while maintaining transparency and accountability. The NO will include AI impact assessments, which will evaluate the risks of AI applications before their deployment in high-risk areas such as public services, healthcare, and law enforcement. To further promote responsible AI development, Curaçao could implement AI regulatory sandboxes. These controlled environments will allow startups and enterprises to test AI applications while gradually working toward full regulatory compliance. The sandbox model will enable experimentation with AI-driven innovations in fields such as healthcare, finance, tourism, and e-government, while ensuring consumer protection and risk mitigation. Additionally, Curaçao must strengthen data privacy and cybersecurity regulations to protect personal data and ensure the safe deployment of AI systems. The existing data protection framework could include more GDPR alignment, ensuring that AI technologies adhere to stringent privacy standards. New cybersecurity regulations should b",

Institutional Framework: Governing AI in Curaçao To effectively regulate and promote AI development, it is recommended that Curaçao organize its AI Oversight across ministries. The agencies responsible will coordinate the oversight on policy implementation, regulatory compliance, and AI funding programs. The initiative will facilitate collaboration between government ministries, universities, private sector partners, and international organizations to ensure that AI development aligns with national economic goals and ethical standards. The AI Oversight should contain an Ethics Committee tasked with conducting AI audits, risk assessments, and ethical evaluations. This Committee will monitor AI systems in critical sectors such as finance, healthcare, and public administration, ensuring that they comply with ethical guidelines. The committee will also develop guidelines on AI fairness, bias detection, and accountability, protecting citizens from potential AI-related harms. To facilitate data-driven AI policymaking, Curaçao will establish an AI Policy Laboratory to help coordinate and assist integrated policy development. This laboratory will collect and analyze data on AI adoption trends, market impact, and research progress. Utilization of real-time data will enable policymakers to make informed decisions about AI regulation, funding priorities, and investment strategies. At the local level, the government can designate AI liaisons in neighborhood centers to oversee AI adoption in smart initiatives, public transportation, and urban planning. These efforts will ensure that AI-driven solutions are tailored to local needs and integrated into public services efficiently. Recommendations – Institutional Framework: Governing AI in Curaçao",

Capacity Building and Training Curaçao must invest in AI education and workforce development to ensure that its citizens have the necessary skills to thrive in an AI-driven economy. A key priority is the integration of AI and Data Science in the national education system, starting from primary school through higher education. The training of teachers is essential to enable the introduction of AI in school curricula covering machine learning, data ethics, and computational thinking, while tertiary-level institutions would offer specialized degrees in AI, robotics, and automation. To accelerate AI skills training for professionals, Curaçao has the opportunity to establish AI training and certification programs within a broader framework for lifelong learning in order to consider the multifaceted aspects of AI. This aims to enable reselling and upskilling to roll out in a responsible and ethical manner. These programs will equip professionals from various industries, including finance, tourism, and healthcare, with practical AI knowledge. The government could also offer reskilling programs for workers at risk of displacement due to automation, ensuring a smooth transition into AI-related jobs.
