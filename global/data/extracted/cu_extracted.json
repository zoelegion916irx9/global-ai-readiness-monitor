The world is now set to change at a pace not seen in decades, \neven centuries. AI-based tools and applications make our lives easier, smoother, and richer. They help us move efficiently, \nget informed, get credit, get a job, and get our taxes done.\nBut in its current form, AI reproduces and amplifies many of the social challenges we face. It is not acceptable that around a third of \nthe world’s population still lacks adequate internet access. Upstream, the AI industry is highly concentrated, with just two countries–\nthe United States and China–and a dozen companies accounting for a major share of the sector. This can lead only to greater \ninequality of outcomes–including gender disparities–downstream. Non-diverse AI teams, unrepresentative datasets, and opaque \nand biased algorithms can cause harm, particularly to those who are already vulnerable, whether companies or individuals, children \nand young people, women, or entire democracies.\nThat is why UNESCO drafted the Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, which was adopted in 2021 by 193 \ncountries to make sure AI delivers fair, sustainable, and inclusive outcomes. The Recommendation is based on the protection and \npromotion of human rights, human dignity, and environmental sustainability, and these values are then translated into principles \nsuch as accountability, transparency, and privacy. The Recommendation also sets out concrete policy actions that governments can \ndraw on to steer technological developments in a responsible direction, premised on the belief that light-touch regulation, which \nhas until now remained the norm, is insufficient. We need capable governments that are well equipped, in terms of competencies, \ninstitutions and laws, to frame responsible AI development and protect the rule of law online, and public and private developers \nwho are accountable for putting human rights and fundamental freedoms–not profits or geopolitical considerations–first.\nThe Readiness Assessment Methodology (RAM) is a diagnostic tool intended to assist Member States in upholding their commitment \nto the Recommendation by helping them understand how prepared they are to implement AI ethically and responsibly for all their \ncitizens. By highlighting any institutional, regulatory, or data gaps and obstacles, it enables UNESCO to tailor support for governments \nto fill those gaps to ensure an ethical AI ecosystem aligned wit",

It must also publish open reports on government performance and the use of AI in Cuba. 1.3. Evaluate the development of an Artificial Intelligence Law The relevance and need for broad AI regulation must be evaluated. For this, it is relevant to study the risks in the uses of AI and how they could be addressed in specific legislation without harming research and innovation in this area. Along these lines, the systems that will be considered AI and the associated risk levels must be adequately defined. Furthermore, principles must be incorporated in specific legislation or an eventual general regulation that covers issues such as proportionality and harm, safety and security, equity and non-discrimination, supervision and human decision-making, transparency and explainability, and accountability and responsibility.

Along these lines, it is recommended that use cases that require contextual analysis and issue guides be identified for recommendations and ethical use of AI in these areas.

Along these lines, it must be analysed how automation through AI can generate unemployment and/or modify existing jobs significantly. Furthermore, the same labour relations and required skills change with the emergence of AI-based systems. Cuba should create a policy to address these impacts on the labour market. 1.7.2. Health The RAM detects that, although there are general policies that address general health, AI is not addressed as a specific issue. Along these lines, given the unique opportunities in the field of health as well as the emerging risks in this area, it is recommended to work on a specific sector policy and/or significantly update the existing Public Health policy with a section dedicated to AI. 1.7.3. Culture In the field of culture, AI also presents significant and novel opportunities and risks. On the one hand, the use of AI can foster new forms of art in collaboration with AI or facilitate the protection and preservation of existing cultural heritage. However, this same technology blurs the limits of what creativity, authorship and the minimum subsistence of a cultural identity means that can be lost in the generation of artistic products in an automated way and based on the training of systems. Thus, it is recommended to promote a policy that addresses the use of these technologies in the cultural field and promotes safeguards for artists and Cuban cultural heritage. 1.7.4.

In addition, it is urged to review repositories related to the topic, such as the OECD repositories, to identify the indicators that are not being built and the information that is not being collected in the country. In line with the above, it is recommended that standards be followed and that data be reported to the corresponding international organisations (e.g., OECD, World Bank, World Economic Forum, United Nations). This will improve transparency and data quality. 2.2. Collect specific data from the AI ecosystem. It is recommended that data collection on the development and use of AI be promoted, mainly in companies. In particular, information on spending and adoption in the industry and information on employment and skills required for AI-related positions should be collected. To have more disaggregated information, these data must have gender, age, and urban/rural criteria. 26 2.3. Open data policy Cuba has no open data policy and has not signed commitments like the Open Data Charter. In line with the two previous actions, it is recommended that Cuba acquire commitments to open data and advance a policy that makes it public and available on a periodic and transparent basis. It is worth mentioning that it is not enough to publish statistics in a yearbook; we must move towards opening databases in machine-readable format33 , with different download options, clear responsible parties, and adequate metadata that are kept updated and usable. 2.4.

Increase AI R&D spending Although the data does not allow us to identify specific spending on R&D in AI, it can be seen that R&D spending in general is low in Cuba. Along these lines, it is recommended that the state increase investment in R&D and focus primarily on AI to develop it as a critical sector for the economy and public use in Cuba. It is recommended that funds be created focused on basic research and AI technology transfer. These can promote research and development both locally and in collaboration with universities and companies outside the country. 3.10.. Increase AI R&D spending",
