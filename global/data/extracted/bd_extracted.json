AI-based tools and applications make our lives \neasier, smoother and richer. They help us move efficiently, get \ninformed, get credit, get a job or get our taxes done.\nBut in its current form, AI reproduces and amplifies many of \nthe social challenges we face. It is not acceptable that around \none-third of the world’s population still lacks adequate internet \naccess. Upstream, the AI industry is highly concentrated, with \njust a few countries and a dozen companies accounting for a \nmajor share of the sector. This can only lead to greater inequality \nof outcomes – including gender disparities – downstream. \nNon-diverse AI teams, unrepresentative datasets, and opaque and biased algorithms can cause harm, \nparticularly to those who are already vulnerable, whether companies or individuals, children and \nyoung people, women or entire democracies.\nThat is why UNESCO drafted the Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, which was \nadopted by 193 countries in 2021, to make sure AI delivers fair, sustainable and inclusive outcomes. \nThe Recommendation is based on the protection and promotion of human rights, human dignity \nand environmental sustainability, and these values are then translated into principles such as \naccountability, transparency and privacy. The Recommendation also sets out concrete policy actions \nthat governments can draw on to steer technological developments in a responsible direction, \npremised on the belief that light-touch regulation, which has been the norm until now, is insufficient. \nWe need capable governments that are well equipped, in terms of competencies, institutions and \nlaws, to frame responsible AI development and protect the rule of law online; and public and private \ndevelopers who are accountable for putting human rights and fundamental freedoms – not profits or \ngeopolitical considerations – first.\nThe Readiness Assessment Methodology (RAM) is a diagnostic tool intended to assist Member States \nin upholding their commitment to the Recommendation by helping them understand how prepared \nthey are to implement AI ethically and responsibly for all their citizens. By highlighting any institutional, \nregulatory or data gaps and obstacles, it enables UNESCO to tailor support for governments to fill \nthose gaps to ensure an ethical AI ecosystem aligned with the Recommendation.\nBangladesh’s readiness assessment reflects a nation actively laying the foundations for responsible \nand inclusive AI development. A draft National AI Policy is currently under review, seeking to build on \nthe principles of UNESCO’s Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence. The forthcoming \npolicy outlines a comprehensive implementation framework, emphasizing ethics, human rights, \ntransparency and accountability in AI use. It also seeks to clarify institutional responsibilities and \ncoordination mechanisms across ministries, academia and industry to ensure cohesive governance. \nIn parallel, recent initiatives such as the Personal Data Protection Ordinance and the Cyber Security \nOrdinance aim to establish a complementary legal framework for data governance and digital security, \n",

However, the National Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Policy (Government of Bangladesh, 2018b) references social equity and universal access (Chapter 2, ‘Visions and objectives’, Section 2.2.3). One notable initiative towards gender equity is the Her Power project, or (women’s empowerment through technology) initiated by the ICT Division.23 This project offers women-focused training in ICT fields, including e-commerce, information technology (IT) services, web development and graphic design. Existing wage disparities in the ICT sector, including in entry-level roles such as data entry, highlight the need for policy interventions to promote equal pay and facilitate the upskilling of women, enabling them to transition into higher-value technological roles (Hossain, 2018). While broader education policies, such as the National Education Policy (Government of Bangladesh, 2010), encourage increased female participation in education, they do not specifically address the digital gender divide. Bangladesh does not have targeted policies to address rural-urban disparities; however, general references to socio-economic disparities in this context exist in various policy documents. The draft National AI Policy (Government of Bangladesh, 2024) and the Smart Bangladesh: ICT Master Plan 2041 (Government of Bangladesh, 2023b) acknowledge these inequalities. The previous government’s manifesto included a My Village-My Town initiati",

      "text": "13 While Bangladesh has benefited from previous digitalization initiatives, which proved particularly valuable during the COVID-19 pandemic (a2i, 2023), the pandemic also exposed a significant digital divide. For example, limited access to devices in urban slum areas hindered residents’ ability to receive essential digital services, including mobile financial aid (Siddiquee et al., 2022). By contrast, rural communities demonstrated resilience by relying on resource-sharing arrangements to overcome similar challenges.26 The lack of continuous, and reliable electricity poses a significant challenge, too. While almost 100 per cent of Bangladesh’s population has access to electricity,27 power cuts are an issue (Varadhan and Chew, 2023), especially in rural areas, where daily interruptions can extend to seven or eight hours. These disparities are even more pronounced in geographically and administratively complex regions, such as the Chittagong Hill Tracts, where transportation difficulties and dual administrative systems often result in confusion regarding service delivery channels. Although previous digitalization initiatives, such as those rolled out under the Bangladesh Vision 2021 programme (Centre for Policy Dialogue, 2007), improved connectivity and literacy, gender, occupational and regional disparities persisted. For instance, garment workers, despite having smartphones, faced language barriers and lacked the time and resources to engage meaningfully with digital technologies.28 Similarly, communities in marginalized regions, including tea gardens, had limited internet access, leaving them disconnected from broader digital advancements.29 There are additional challenges associated with disparities in the cost of communication between urban and rural areas, where marginalized populations often incur higher expenses (Hasan, 2025).

Currently, Bangladesh does not have dedicated policies to promote diversity within the digital workforce, and there are no requirements mandating government contractors, academia or technology firms to publicly disclose diversity statistics. Language inclusion is also a key consideration in AI development and innovation. The scarcity of diversified datasets impedes effective AI system training in local languages. Despite access to advanced tools like ChatGPT, output in Bengali remains suboptimal due to the limited availability of open-source datasets. Data translation from English to Bengali often results in poor outcomes, negatively impacting model performance. The Enhancement of Bangla Language in ICT through Research & Development (EBLICT) project,30 under the Bangladesh Computer Council31 and the ICT Division, is a notable initiative meant to address this gap. It has been working on several projects to increase the inclusion of Bengali in the AI landscape, and has developed solutions, such as a sentiment analyser,32 an optical character recognizer,33 a spell checker,34 a speech-to-text and a text-to-speech generator,35 etc. These solutions are availabl",

Bangladesh ranked 8th of 100 countries in ‘trust in government websites and apps’ as per the Economist Impact’s Inclusive Internet Index 2022, with a score of 72 per cent.42 It is noteworthy, however, that this score may not fully reflect recent political developments in Bangladesh nor the perspectives gathered during stakeholder consultations, which indicated a degree of eroded trust in the previous administration.

Environmental and sustainability policies The draft National AI Policy 2024 identifies the environment as a priority sector for AI application. Specifically, Section 4.4 (‘Environment, energy, and climate change’) underscores the potential role of AI in optimizing renewable energy production, enhancing weather forecasting capabilities and improving water resource management (Government of Bangladesh, 2024). While the draft policy provides a comprehensive overview of AI applications in environmental conservation, it places comparatively less emphasis on the environmental impact of and sustainability considerations around AI technologies themselves.

Despite these hurdles, the concept of blended education has gained momentum, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, and a framework is now in place to support its development. The previous government introduced several platforms or applications aimed at enhancing educational access and efficiency. These include: • \u0007Teachers’ Portal ( )49 is an online platform for teachers designed to create and retrieve digital educational content for different subjects for classroom teaching. • \u0007Dikkha ( ) is an initiative that integrates digital and multimedia classroom solutions, establishing an effective network that connects teachers and students across the country. • \u0007Noipunno ( )50 is another data framework designed to support teachers and students; however, it is not operational currently. • \u0007Kishor Batayon ( )51 helps students manage their classes and coursework. The ICT Division’s Hour of Code programme encourages school students to dedicate one hour each day to learning coding skills,52 while UNICEF and the Directorate of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education have developed gamified learning content, currently being piloted in twenty-four schools.53 AI integration into the country’s education system remains in its early stages, with significant potential for expansion.

The secondary education curriculum introduces a course on ICT at every level from Grade 6 to Grade 12 (National Curriculum and Textbook Board, 2012: Section 5.2). Every textbook includes a chapter on ICT safety, security and ethical use, but does not detail technical aspects like programming or database management. • \u0007Grade 6 > Chapter 3: The safe use of Information and Communication Technology (National Curriculum and Textbook Board, 2017a) • \u0007Grade 7 > Chapter 3: Safe and ethical use (National Curriculum and Textbook Board, 2017b) • \u0007Grade 8 > Chapter 3: Safe and ethical use of Information and Communication Technology (National Curriculum and Textbook Board, 2017c) • \u0007Grade 9-10 > Chapter 2: Computer and security of the user (National Curriculum and Textbook Board, 2017d) Year Lower secondary schools Secondary schools ",

Besides these institutionalized courses, the Digital Security Agency of the ICT Division offers a course on cybersecurity and usage of digital tools for secondary and higher secondary students. When it comes to higher education, there is a gap between the technical and ethical aspects of AI education. Existing ICT and AI curricula are predominantly oriented towards technical competencies, such as coding and machine learning, with limited emphasis on critical ethical considerations, including privacy protection, bias mitigation and algorithmic fairness. Furthermore, soft skills relevant to ethical AI practices – such as responsible data use – are not yet systematically integrated into educational frameworks, though they are essential for fostering responsible AI development and deployment. While AI, including its ethical dimensions, is largely absent from primary and secondary education curricula, notable progress has been made at the tertiary level. Universities have begun incorporating foundational AI tools into curricula across disciplines. Alongside, teacher-training programmes for secondary and higher secondary educators employ blended learning models that create opportunities for future AI integration. Nevertheless, a stronger focus on embedding the ethical aspects of AI in curricula, alongside efforts to bridge existing gaps in",
