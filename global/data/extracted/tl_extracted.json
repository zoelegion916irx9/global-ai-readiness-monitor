While \nthe nation has laid foundational groundwork in \nInformation, Communication and Technology (ICT) \ninfrastructure and digital literacy, as evidenced by \nthe Timor Digital 2032 strategy and investments in \nconnectivity, the integration of Artificial Intelligence \n(AI) into national policy and discourse remains in its \nearly stages. Currently positioned as a downstream \nuser of AI, primarily a consumer of technologies \ndeveloped elsewhere, Timor-Leste possesses a latent \npotential that can be unlocked through strategic and \ncoordinated action.\nSignificant policy and infrastructural advancements are already underway. The ongoing \nrevision of the nation’s primary digital ICT strategy, Timor Digital 2032, to incorporate AI \nprovisions, coupled with legislative reforms addressing the dynamic technological landscape, \nsignals a commendable governmental commitment to adapting to the global digital \nenvironment. Furthermore, strategic investments in foundational ICT infrastructure, notably \nthe submarine cable and plans for a centralized, advanced data center, are crucial steps \ntowards creating the necessary environment for future AI development and deployment \nwithin government sectors.\nThis document serves as a comprehensive diagnostic of Timor-Leste’s national AI landscape, \nanalyzing the prevailing conditions across legal, socio-cultural, scientific and educational, \neconomic, and infrastructural contexts.
