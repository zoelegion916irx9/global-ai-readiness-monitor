The world is now \nset to change at a pace not seen in decades, even centuries. AI-based tools and \napplications make our lives easier, smoother, and richer. They help us move efficiently, \nget informed, get credit, get a job, and get our taxes done.\nBut in its current form, AI reproduces and amplifies many of the social challenges we face. It is not acceptable that \naround a third of the world’s population still lacks adequate internet access. Upstream, the AI industry is highly \nconcentrated, with just two countries – the United States and China – and a dozen companies accounting for a \nmajor share of the sector. This can lead only to greater inequality of outcomes – including gender disparities – \ndownstream. Non-diverse AI teams, unrepresentative datasets, and opaque and biased algorithms can cause harm, \nparticularly to those who are already vulnerable, whether companies or individuals, children and young people, \nwomen, or entire democracies.\nThat is why UNESCO drafted the Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, which was adopted in 2021 \nby 193 countries to make sure AI delivers fair, sustainable, and inclusive outcomes. The Recommendation is based \non the protection and promotion of human rights, human dignity, and environmental sustainability, and these \nvalues are then translated into principles such as accountability, transparency, and privacy. The Recommendation \nalso sets out concrete policy actions that governments can draw on to steer technological developments in a \nresponsible direction, premised on the belief that light-touch regulation, which has until now remained the norm, is \ninsufficient. We need capable governments that are well equipped, in terms of competencies, institutions and laws, \nto frame responsible AI development and protect the rule of law online, and public and private developers who are \naccountable for putting human rights and fundamental freedoms – not profits or geopolitical considerations – first.\nForeword\nLidia Brit",
