AI-based tools and applications make our lives \neasier, smoother and richer. They help us move efficiently, get \ninformed, get credit, get a job or get our taxes done.\nBut in its current form, AI reproduces and amplifies many of \nthe social challenges we face. It is not acceptable that around \none-third of the world’s population still lacks adequate internet \naccess. Upstream, the AI industry is highly concentrated, with \njust two countries – the United States and China – and a dozen \ncompanies accounting for a major share of the sector. This can \nonly lead to greater inequality of outcomes – including gender \ndisparities – downstream. Non-diverse AI teams, unrepresentative datasets, and opaque and biased \nalgorithms can cause harm, particularly to those who are already vulnerable, whether companies or \nindividuals, children and young people, women or entire democracies.\nThat is why UNESCO drafted the Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, which was \nadopted by 193 countries in 2021, to make sure AI delivers fair, sustainable and inclusive outcomes. \nThe Recommendation is based on the protection and promotion of human rights, human dignity \nand environmental sustainability, and these values are then translated into principles such as \naccountability, transparency and privacy. The Recommendation also sets out concrete policy actions \nthat governments can draw on to steer technological developments in a responsible direction, \npremised on the belief that light-touch regulation, which has been the norm until now, is insufficient. \nWe need capable governments that are well equipped, in terms of competencies, institutions and \nlaws, to frame responsible AI development and protect the rule of law online; and public and private \ndevelopers who are accountable for putting human rights and fundamental freedoms – not profits \nor geopolitical considerations – first.\nThe Readiness Assessment Methodology (RAM) is a diagnostic tool intended to assist Member States \nin upholding their commitment to the Recommendation by helping them understand how prepared \nthey are to implement AI ethically and responsibly for all their citizens. By highlighting any institutional, \nregulatory or data gaps and obstacles, it enables UNESCO to tailor support for governments to fill \nthose gaps to ensure an ethical AI ecosystem aligned with the Recommendation.\nOverall, this report presents a fundamentally optimistic vision that we at UNESCO share: that ethical \ngovernance and responsible regulation of AI is entirely consistent with innovation and economic \ngrowth and is essential for ensuring a technological ecosystem that benefits the public good. With \nthe RAM data and this report, Maldives has a clear roadmap for how to get there.\nIt was a pleasure working with the Government of Maldives to conduct this exercise. We are grateful \nfor their engagement with the RAM, and I am sure that by following the p",

This law should be aligned with international standards to safeguard personal data and enhance public trust in AI technologies. UNESCO has published guidelines for Member States on how to open their data in a sustainable manner, how to build capacities in this regard, and how to build an open-data-driven culture (UNESCO, 2023b).

These policies should outline necessary criteria for purchasing AI systems, including requirements for ethical compliance, technical robustness and alignment with national AI goals and standards. The policies should specifically include accessibility requirements for persons with disabilities. The accessibility should be tested and endorsed by persons with disabilities. By setting these standards, the government can ensure that AI systems are developed with ethical considerations in mind. A national-level coordinating initiative can harmonize sector-specific AI procurement needs and policies by establishing standardized guidelines and frameworks. This could include developing model contracts and procurement templates. These policies should also include mechanisms for the evaluation and oversight of contracted AI systems, with regular assessments to guarantee compliance with established guidelines. This allows for the continuous improvement of AI systems and their adaptation to evolving standards and societal needs, ensuring that AI systems remain aligned with government objectives.",

An AI Centre of Excellence would also provide training and capacity-building programmes, fostering a skilled workforce and promoting a culture of AI-driven innovation in Maldives. These activities could include partnerships with government entities and academic institutions to promote research and the sharing of best practices in AI. Moreover, an AI Centre of Excellence could host incubators, accelerators and co-working spaces for AI start-ups.

In healthcare, for example, AI-powered diagnostic tools can analyse medical images to help doctors detect diseases earlier and more accurately. In education, AI-driven adaptive learning systems can tailor educational content to individual students’ needs, abilities and learning styles. For the environment, AI-powered monitoring systems can analyse satellite imagery and sensor data to track rising sea-levels, predict coastal erosion and identify areas most vulnerable to climate change, enabling proactive conservation efforts. In finance, AI-based fraud-detection systems can analyse transaction patterns to identify and prevent fraudulent activities, reducing financial losses and protecting customers.

Scholarships and financial incentives could be offered to students pursuing STEM and AI-related degrees, making these fields more attractive and accessible. Partnerships with international universities and institutions could also provide opportunities for Maldivian students to study abroad and gain exposure to cutting-edge technologies. Moreover, the government could work with the private sector to provide internships, apprenticeships and job opportunities for STEM and AI graduates, ensuring that they are able to apply their skills and knowledge as part of the workforce. By creating a pipeline of opportunities, the government can encourage more students to pursue an education in STEM and AI-related fields, thus increasing the number of graduates in these areas. A particular focus should be on girls and women, given their strong performances in mathematics and interest in new technologies. This requires addressing and overcoming the stereotypes and barriers that women face in the field by featuring female role models and success stories, for example, thus inspiring and encouraging women to pursue careers in AI. Moreover, women’s participation in AI can also help address the gender biases that may be embedded in AI systems, ensuring that these technologies are fair, transparent and accountable.
