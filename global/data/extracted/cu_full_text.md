## Recommendations

### Recommendation 1: Cuba is behind in terms of AI ecosystem and governance development, which means a double challenge: addressing institutionality
Cuba is behind in terms of AI ecosystem and governance development, which means a double challenge: addressing institutionality and technological development gaps and developing a roadmap to promote ethical and human rights-respectful use of AI. AI.

### Recommendation 2: Along these lines, the recommendations presented below point to these two challenges, but they start from previous elements
Along these lines, the recommendations presented below point to these two challenges, but they start from previous elements that enable an exemplary deployment of AI.

### Recommendation 3: Table 1. List of the ten priority recommendations
Table 1. List of the ten priority recommendations 1.REGULATION 1.1. Creation and implementation of a National Artificial Intelligence Strategy. 1.2. Create multi-stakeholder governance with the participation of international observers. 1.3. International assessment of personal data laws, freedom of information and access to knowledge, and online security and content integrity laws. 2.DATA 2.1. Improve data collection of the R&D&i ecosystem 2.2. Open data policy 2.3. International consultancies t

### Recommendation 4: Along these lines, to develop the ENIA, it is recommended that a process that includes open deliberation sessions and public
Along these lines, to develop the ENIA, it is recommended that a process that includes open deliberation sessions and public consultation with the support and observation of international expert. . Elements such as information given to citizens when subjected to AI systems, decision-challenging mechanisms, and guarantees of transparency and accountability to citizens must be incorporated. The development of an ENIA must go beyond AI in the State, addressing mechanisms to promote the private sect

### Recommendation 5: One of the weakest elements in the RAM are the digital services indicators (OSI) and electronic participation (EPI). In this line, the ENIA
One of the weakest elements in the RAM are the digital services indicators (OSI) and electronic participation (EPI). In this line, the ENIA should be developed with a robust institutional framework to improve these indicators.

### Recommendation 6: Along these lines, it is recommended that a governance body be created that is made up of people from different sectors of society
Along these lines, it is recommended that a governance body be created that is made up of people from different sectors of society and observers from international organisations. The latter will provide an expert and neutral look at more developed organisations and countries in terms of their AI ecosystem and governance. This body should review the policy's implementation and observe the impacts of technology in general and state initiatives. It must also publish open reports on government perfo

### Recommendation 7: Prohibition of unacceptable uses.
Prohibition of unacceptable uses. • Equity and non-discrimination. •

### Recommendation 8: Technical and ethical standard.
Technical and ethical standard. Cuba should follow up on existing regulatory experiences and discussions, such as the recently published European law or the debate of Chile, Brazil, and Peru laws, among others. 1.4. Develop regulations for the ethical acquisition of AI systems.

### Recommendation 9: Legislation and public procurement procedures are essential elements for the ethical use of AI. Appropriate procurement
Legislation and public procurement procedures are essential elements for the ethical use of AI. Appropriate procurement mechanisms, especially in a country with a large State, can promote good ethical practices that give proper signals to the private and academic sectors. In the RAM, it was seen that there is no specific regulation for the acquisition of AI systems that have adequate elements for their correct purchase and operation in the State. Furthermore, these procedures can incorporate UNE

### Recommendation 10: Currently, Cuba does not participate in any discussion on technical and ethical standards related to AI, such as ISO or EEEI. Along
Currently, Cuba does not participate in any discussion on technical and ethical standards related to AI, such as ISO or EEEI. Along these lines, it is recommended to start conversations with organisations to join as observers in the relevant groups (e.g., JTC1) and, over time, as full members. The latter applies to having a voice that allows the Cuban reality to be brought to the standards, which are usually dominated by the countries of the Global North. 1.6. Creation of specific guides on the

### Recommendation 11: Furthermore, the guides allow for promoting principles and good practices aligned with the UNESCO recommendation without
Furthermore, the guides allow for promoting principles and good practices aligned with the UNESCO recommendation without necessarily resorting to the formulation of new laws. This allows for greater agility and potential for updating and adaptation. 1.7. Creation of sectoral policies that incorporate the impact of AI and its responsible use

### Recommendation 12: Currently, Cuba does not participate in any discussion on technical and ethical standards related to AI, such as ISO or EEEI. Along
Currently, Cuba does not participate in any discussion on technical and ethical standards related to AI, such as ISO or EEEI. Along these lines, it is recommended to start conversations with organisations to join as observers in the relevant groups (e.g., JTC1) and, over time, as full members. The latter applies to having a voice that allows the Cuban reality to be brought to the standards, which are usually dominated by the countries of the Global North.

### Recommendation 13: Various areas were detected in which, although AI advances may have a significant impact, no specific policies address them. Along
Various areas were detected in which, although AI advances may have a significant impact, no specific policies address them. Along these lines, it is recommended to evaluate relevance and develop guidelines for at least the following four areas: 1.7.1. Working market

### Recommendation 14: Currently, there are no policies that address the impact of AI on employment. Along these lines, it must be analysed how automation
Currently, there are no policies that address the impact of AI on employment. Along these lines, it must be analysed how automation through AI can generate unemployment and/or modify existing jobs significantly. Furthermore, the same labour relations and required skills change with the emergence of AI-based systems. Cuba should create a policy to address these impacts on the labour market. 1.7.2. Health The RAM detects that, although there are general policies that address general health, AI is

### Recommendation 15: If necessary, the development of a regulation that establishes impact evaluations can be discussed.
If necessary, the development of a regulation that establishes impact evaluations can be discussed. 25 1.8. Review, evaluation and updating of related legislation The analysis shows that in several relevant cases, such as the protection of personal data, Cuba has updated legislation that came into force a few years ago. However, there are still areas where laws do not necessarily adapt to the impacts and challenges that AI brings with it or do not fully align with recommendations on its ethical

### Recommendation 16: International evaluation of personal data laws, freedom of information and access to knowledge, and online security and
International evaluation of personal data laws, freedom of information and access to knowledge, and online security and content integrity. It is recommended that the laws be evaluated by international experts on the subject and updated according to these reports. In particular, some challenges are detected in personal data, freedom of information and access to knowledge, online security, and content integrity that could put citizens at risk.

### Recommendation 17: Along these lines, it is recommended that the laws and how they could adequately protect human rights in using digital technologies
Along these lines, it is recommended that the laws and how they could adequately protect human rights in using digital technologies such as AI be subjected to an expert and external evaluation. For example, although the personal data law provides adequate rights to individuals, it has exceptions and limitations that should be considered so as not to leave citizens unprotected. 1.8.2.

### Recommendation 18: Review and evaluation of the mechanisms and laws that provide procedural guarantees and accountability in the context
Review and evaluation of the mechanisms and laws that provide procedural guarantees and accountability in the context of AI

### Recommendation 19: There is no updated legislation regarding procedural guarantees and accountability that adequately adapts to the use of AI in
There is no updated legislation regarding procedural guarantees and accountability that adequately adapts to the use of AI in public or private systems. Therefore, it is recommended that existing regulations be reviewed, external evaluations requested and updated so citizens have due process when AI systems are involved. 1.9. Training and certification programs for the public sector A relevant need revealed from the application of RAM is the lack of training and certification programs for public

### Recommendation 20: AI systems, among others. This is not only for the use of technology in the State but also for the correct monitoring and supervision
AI systems, among others. This is not only for the use of technology in the State but also for the correct monitoring and supervision of the private sector. 2. DATA 2.1. Improve data collection of the R&D&I ecosystem with a focus on AI

### Recommendation 21: One of the main gaps detected in this evaluation is the lack of data on the economy, research, innovation, and the labour market
One of the main gaps detected in this evaluation is the lack of data on the economy, research, innovation, and the labour market related to technology. Although the State generates statistics and has its Yearbook, it does not necessarily follow the international collection standards that allow their comparison and ensure their quality.

### Recommendation 22: Along these lines, it is recommended that data measurement from the R&D ecosystem be promoted in a granular and transparent
Along these lines, it is recommended that data measurement from the R&D ecosystem be promoted in a granular and transparent manner, with the methodologies and databases for the correct construction of baselines made available. For data collection, it is recommended that standards and manuals such as those of Frascati and Oslo be followed. In addition, it is urged to review repositories related to the topic, such as the OECD repositories, to identify the indicators that are not being built and th

### Recommendation 23: One of the main gaps detected was in the e-participation (EPI) and digital services indicators (OSI). Along these lines, it is
One of the main gaps detected was in the e-participation (EPI) and digital services indicators (OSI). Along these lines, it is recommended to generate a strategy to improve services and e-participation, working on the technological tools that serve citizens. Therefore, it is recommended that international organizations conduct consultancies and audits processes and suggest improvements. 3. CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT 3.1. Priority promotion of policies to improve connectivity

### Recommendation 24: One of the main gaps detected in RAM is access to high-speed internet, electronic devices, and electricity. For an AI strategy to
One of the main gaps detected in RAM is access to high-speed internet, electronic devices, and electricity. For an AI strategy to be properly implemented and for the technology to effectively mean a positive change for citizens, they have to be able to take advantage of it and to do so, they require access through mobile devices and the internet.

### Recommendation 25: Thus, the goal should be to advance Internet access levels, improve upload and download speeds, and facilitate international
Thus, the goal should be to advance Internet access levels, improve upload and download speeds, and facilitate international data transfer. For this, connectivity infrastructure must be improved, and policies must be designed to allow households to access technology. As mentioned, speed must also be improved. Thus, work must be done to ensure access to higher-speed networks (4G, 5G). 3.2. Rural policy to address the gap in access to electricity and internet The urban-rural access gap is signific

### Recommendation 26: However, when access is so low, simply deploying connectivity infrastructure is not enough; education and training programs in
However, when access is so low, simply deploying connectivity infrastructure is not enough; education and training programs in digital technologies must accompany it. If people without access are exposed to the infrastructure and not shown its opportunities, change is slower, and the risks of misuse or abuse are more significant. 3.3. Updating education curricula at all levels A global challenge to which Cuba is no stranger is updating educational curricula at all levels. This should not be done

### Recommendation 27: Along these lines, the primary and secondary school curriculum must incorporate elements such as critical thinking, computational
Along these lines, the primary and secondary school curriculum must incorporate elements such as critical thinking, computational thinking, algorithmic thinking, ethics in digital environments, etc. Along the same lines, work should be done in computer science-related careers to include courses on critical analysis of technologies, which allow them to go beyond their development and use and analyse the values involved and the impact of technological systems on different stakeholders and how to n

### Recommendation 28: Along these lines, it is recommended that tertiary education programs focused on AI incorporate significant components of ethical
Along these lines, it is recommended that tertiary education programs focused on AI incorporate significant components of ethical use. This should be done not only at the university level but also at the professional technical level. 27 3.4. Policy for the use of AI in educational environments

### Recommendation 29: AI not only presents the challenge of teaching its use but can also be used in educational settings to promote learning. There is
AI not only presents the challenge of teaching its use but can also be used in educational settings to promote learning. There is evidence of AI's potential to offer personalised pathways in academic environments and support children's education in more creative and adaptive ways. However, if the above is done carelessly, there is a risk of harming learning and children. On the other hand, the emergence of generative AI puts this technology within reach from a very early age. By being able to in

### Recommendation 30: All of the above requires the generation of a specialised policy on the use of AI in educational environments that allows extracting
All of the above requires the generation of a specialised policy on the use of AI in educational environments that allows extracting its benefits while protecting people in their learning processes. 3.5. Training program for teachers and educators on AI and its ethical use A fundamental need beyond updating the curriculum or a policy for the use of AI in educational environments is the training of teachers and educators. If those in charge of leading the learning process are not trained, the res

Along these same lines, it is recommended that collaboration programs with universities from other countries be established that allow the exchange of students and academics in projects related to the development and use of AI. 3.7. Incentive program for participation in software development spaces such as GitHub and Kaggle

### Recommendation 33: Activity around AI is measured through publications and patents and participation in open software development environments
Activity around AI is measured through publications and patents and participation in open software development environments such as GitHub or development competitions such as Kaggle. The RAM application revealed meagre participation of Cubans in these environments, which shows the need to encourage the country's developers to participate in these instances to contribute and improve the area. Along these lines, it is recommended to design an incentive program that promotes this participation. 3.8

### Recommendation 34: AI is a general-purpose technology found in various areas of people's daily lives. Therefore, the general population must have basic
AI is a general-purpose technology found in various areas of people's daily lives. Therefore, the general population must have basic knowledge of interacting with AI systems responsibly and safely. Consequently, it is recommended that massive and free courses on AI, its applications, and its ethical and safe use be developed. 3.9. Increase AI R&D spending Although the data does not allow us to identify specific spending on R&D in AI, it can be seen that R&D spending in general is low in Cuba. Al

One key component for developing AI systems that adapt to local reality is data. Along these lines, it is recommended to create open repositories for the training of Cuban systems in different industrial and government sectors. These repositories are complex and must be evaluated and audited periodically by international experts to review potential biases that could harm users of the systems trained in them.. 28 3.11.

Foreword
We have officially entered the Age of Artificial Intelligence. The world is now set to change at a pace not seen in decades, 
even centuries. AI-based tools and applications make our lives easier, smoother, and richer. They help us move efficiently, 
get informed, get credit, get a job, and get our taxes done.
But in its current form, AI reproduces and amplifies many of the social challenges we face. It is not acceptable that around a third of 
the world’s population still lacks adequate internet access. Upstream, the AI industry is highly concentrated, with just two countries–
the United States and China–and a dozen companies accounting for a major share of the sector. This can lead only to greater 
inequality of outcomes–including gender disparities–downstream. Non-diverse AI teams, unrepresentative datasets, and opaque 
and biased algorithms can cause harm, particularly to those who are already vulnerable, whether companies or individuals, children 
and young people, women, or entire democracies.
That is why UNESCO drafted the Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, which was adopted in 2021 by 193 
countries to make sure AI delivers fair, sustainable, and inclusive outcomes. The Recommendation is based on the protection and 
promotion of human rights, human dignity, and environmental sustainability, and these values are then translated into principles 
such as accountability, transparency, and privacy. The Recommendation also sets out concrete policy actions that governments can 
draw on to steer technological developments in a responsible direction, premised on the belief that light-touch regulation, which 
has until now remained the norm, is insufficient. We need capable governments that are well equipped, in terms of competencies, 
institutions and laws, to frame responsible AI development and protect the rule of law online, and public and private developers 
who are accountable for putting human rights and fundamental freedoms–not profits or geopolitical considerations–first.
The Readiness Assessment Methodology (RAM) is a diagnostic tool intended to assist Member States in upholding their commitment 
to the Recommendation by helping them understand how prepared they are to implement AI ethically and responsibly for all their 
citizens. By highlighting any institutional, regulatory, or data gaps and obstacles, it enables UNESCO to tailor support for governments 
to fill those gaps to ensure an ethical AI ecosystem aligned with the Recommendation.
Cuba was selected to implement the RAM in order to support their efforts in the creation and implementation of their national AI 
strategy, an initiative that we applaud, as it seeks to put AI ethics and governance at the forefront, and we thank them for inviting 
UNESCO to assist in this effort.
The report presented here reveals a panorama of challenges along with Cuba's strong commitment to harnessing the benefits of 
AI while protecting its people. The government launched its strategy just after completing the RAM, which was developed while 
the RAM was being implemented, and allowed the team in charge to incorporate the information collected and its initial findings. 
Furthermore, the final outcome of this document, together with UNESCO recommendations can inform the implementation and 
updating of the strategy.
One of the key recommendations of this report is to implement the AI Strategy and develop an institutional framework that considers 
multiple stakeholders. Likewise, it is recommended to update and evaluate existing laws to strengthen the governance ecosystem.
The report highlights several areas with gaps that must be addressed. For example, data collection revealed the need to have 
statistical systems that collect baseline information to evaluate policies related to digital technologies and that work hand in 
hand with international measurement recommendations. Along these same lines, the urgency was detected to work on digital 
infrastructure, advancing connectivity and reducing urban-rural gaps.
There are several challenges regarding the social and environmental aspects of AI. Cuba has ongoing Gender Equality policies, 
which show relevant results as women have more access to technology than men. However, there is a great challenge in providing 
Internet access to all people, especially those living in rural areas. There is also no specific policy to address the impacts of AI on the 
environment or for the use of AI in the preservation of cultural heritage.

The science and education dimension reveals a low number of authors publishing AI work and a low number of publications. These 
figures are consistent with the fact that the country does not have AI research centers, nor many universities offering undergraduate 
or graduate programs dedicated to AI.
The final section of this report presents a set of useful recommendations for the implementation of the AI strategy. This set of 
comprehensive but focused recommendations includes creating, evaluating and updating AI system acquisition laws, privacy laws, 
among others. In addition, the creation of specific guides for the ethical use of AI in the Cuban context and training and certification 
programs for people who work in the government are recommended.
The recommendations also highlight the need to collect more data on the AI ecosystem of research, development, innovation and 
entrepreneurship. The RAM's recommendations are based on a partial collection of data, but relevant information did not exist in 
various areas. Additionally, more economic and labor data are required to better evaluate the Cuban ecosystem and provide more 
complete recommendations.
Overall, this report presents a fundamentally optimistic vision that we share at UNESCO: that ethical governance and responsible 
regulation of AI are fully consistent with innovation and economic growth and are essential to ensure a technological ecosystem that 
benefits the public good. With the RAM data and this report along with the strategy, Cuba has a clear roadmap on how to get there.
It was a pleasure working with the Government of Cuba to conduct this exercise. We are grateful for their engagement with the 
RAM and I am sure that by following the path laid out in this report, Cuba will be able to reap the benefits of AI while making sure 
that AI technologies deliver fair, sustainable, and inclusive outcomes.

Executive Summary
In November 2021, 193 UNESCO Member States adopted the Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence. 
This global standard aims to harness the positive impact of AI while addressing its inherent risks. Countries around the world 
are now in the process of implementing the Recommendation, and UNESCO supports them through various capacity-building 
efforts. In particular, Cuba was selected as one of the first countries in the region to study its AI ecosystem through the Readiness 
Assessment Methodology (RAM) and thus support the development of its national strategy, which was later launched in 2024.
At the time of the RAM deployment, Cuba did not have an AI strategy or a specific regulatory framework. However, the Ministry of 
Communications was leading a process since 2023 to develop such a strategy, which is urgent and central to applying UNESCO 
recommendations on the ethical use of AI. The strategy was launched in 2024.
In the legal dimension, although Cuba has updated its laws in various relevant areas, such as personal data protection or cybersecurity, 
significant challenges remain, and some areas have not been covered. On the one hand, although existing laws are aligned with 
ethical recommendations, they sometimes have exception regimes that must be reviewed. Along these lines, there is no adequate 
open data policy and the indicators related to digital systems are low. In addition, there are areas where the specific challenges of AI 
have not been addressed, such as the acquisition of systems, procedural guarantees, health, culture, or impacts on the environment.
Considerations of the social and cultural dimensions are central to the ethical and responsible deployment of AI systems, which 
avoids bias throughout their entire life cycle. In this line, various topics are addressed, such as the gender gap, urban-rural, 
and diversity, among others. The work in terms of gender stands out, where it is women who access technology more than men in 
various statistics; however, there are relevant gaps at a general level regarding education and access to technology. An important 
focus is an urban-rural difference, where the gap is significant in terms of access to the internet and electronic devices, leaving people 
in rural areas remarkably unaware of the potential benefits of its use and at risk of being left even further behind in socioeconomic 
terms if this problem is not addressed.
The scientific and educational dimension is critical to the country's technological development and the incorporation of ethical 
principles from the beginning of the AI life cycle. Along these lines, Cuba has significant gaps with a low number of researchers, 
which translates into few publications and no patents. In line with the above, Cuban participation in the development of open 
software is barely detected, and there are no specialised programs on AI in tertiary education. Furthermore, digital technologies 
are not covered holistically in the educational curriculum, as they focus on technical competencies such as programming and not 
critical and computational thinking skills.
In the economic dimension, which considers critical aspects in developing and adopting the labour market and its adaptation, 
Cuba does not have data, making it impossible to establish a baseline. The few existing data indicate a relevant gap in all areas: 
development, adoption, and transformation of work environments.
The technical and infrastructure dimension addresses the country's installed capacity to implement AI-based solutions across 
different sectors. In this dimension, a significant gap regarding connectivity and access to high-speed internet and electronic 
devices is documented. Along the same lines, the country has no relevant computing capacity.
The main recommendations are grouped into three areas: regulation, data and capacity development. Regarding the first, a series 
of recommendations are made to develop a National AI Strategy along with evaluations and legal updates with the support of 
international entities. The need to collect data of better quality and granularity, make processes and methodologies transparent, 
and adhere to international data collection standards that allow reporting to multilateral organisations is emphasised. Finally, 
regarding capacity development, the criticality of advancing connectivity and education is emphasised.
Cuba faces challenges in all dimensions if it wants to advance in AI development and ethical use. However, it can collaborate 
with countries within the region at different stages of development and learn from success stories to cover gaps more quickly.

Implementing RAM reveals substantive gaps but makes it possible to organise an adequate roadmap to develop an equitable, 
safe, and sustainable AI ecosystem.
This initiative is part of UNESCO's effort to contribute to a more ethical and promising future for AI systems globally. UNESCO 
is committed to upholding respect, protection, and promoting human rights, fundamental freedoms, human dignity, 
and environmental and ecosystem well-being, ensuring diversity and inclusion, and fostering peaceful, just, and equitable societies. 
Interconnected. When appropriately managed, the emergence of new technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence, can be harnessed 
for the collective benefit of humanity. In this context, RAM serves to ensure that all nations can achieve a better future, leaving no 
one behind.

DIAGNOSIS OF THE NATIONAL 
SITUATION REGARDING ARTIFICIAL 
INTELLIGENCE
At the time of collecting information, there was no ENIA or specific legislation on AI at the time of collecting RAM data. The first, 
as mentioned in the previous section, a process led by the MINCOM was developed, and the strategy was launched in May 2024. 
In the process, actors from various disciplines and sectors of society were convened to contribute to developing policies. In addition, 
the inputs collected during the RAM application were taken together with the REIA. The need and potential content of specific 
legislation on AI systems will be determined in the future ENIA. The recently launched strategy has 6 axes: (1) ethics and regulatory 
framework, (2) human capital, (3) applications and services, (4) public administration, (5) science and innovation and (6) social 
communication. Currently, the strategy only establishes a series of objectives, so the implementation details and concrete actions 
remain to be seen. .
The main obstacles identified by the consultant and reported by the official counterpart of the Cuban government for the 
development of AI policies and regulations are the following:
	•
Data from international sources are needed to establish an adequate baseline. Although the government reports some 
internal data, there is no transparent access to collection methodologies and primary sources.
	•
Low level of technological development in both companies and research centres.
	•
Geo-political complexities that make access to tools, information, financing sources, and markets, among others, difficult. 
In particular, the counterparts declare that the United States economic-financial blockade has a relevant impact on the 
country's development.
	•
Lack of open, free and informed participation of multiple stakeholders in the technology public policy development process.
.The following sections discuss Cuba's ecosystem in various dimensions: legal, social, cultural, scientific, educational, economic, 
technical, and infrastructure. Often, the data requested by the evaluation tool (RAM) is unavailable. We explain the lack of data to 
demonstrate the need to collect said data in the future.

LEGAL DIMENSION
In this section, the legal dimension will be discussed. The regulatory framework in which AI is situated is crucial to guarantee its 
ethical deployment. The legal and regulatory framework must include effective mechanisms to safeguard and defend the rights of 
citizens' rights and monitor, mitigate and compensate for any unforeseen adverse outcomes resulting from the deployment of AI 
systems. The legal framework includes rules relating to AI, data protection and privacy, data sharing and information accessibility, 
procurement, due process and accountability, online security and content integrity and public sector capacity.
AI POLICY AND REGULATION
In Cuba, there is no ENIA or specific legislation on AI. As mentioned in the previous section, the first was developed in a process led 
by the MINCOM and launched during 2024, after the RAM deployment. In the process, actors from various disciplines and different 
sectors of society have been convened to contribute to the development of the policy. In addition, the inputs collected during 
the RAM application have been taken together with the REIA. The need and potential content of specific legislation on AI systems 
will be determined in the future ENIA.
No specific policies or procedures exist for using AI in the public sector. Furthermore, citizens are not obligated to be informed 
when an AI system is being used in a process that influences them.
DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY
Cuba is ranked 82 out of 182 in the 2020 Global Cybersecurity Index , placing it 10 out of 35 in the Americas with a score of 58.76 
out of 100. Figure 1 details the scores obtained by Cuba in the different dimensions.

Personal data protection is found in the Cuban Constitution3 and Law 149 on the Protection of Personal Data4, which has been in 
force since 2023. The Cuban Constitution establishes in its articles 40, 48 and 97 the value of human dignity with inherent rights, 
including respect for personal and family privacy and access to and control of personal data. Based on this, the law aims to establish 
the principles, procedures and definitions to guarantee the right to personal data protection and regulate its use and treatment 
by public and private entities.
The law defines personal data as “information concerning a natural person, identified or identifiable, that can lead to his or her 
identity.” It considers direct and indirect mechanisms and includes a specific list of personal information elements. However, the law 
establishes limits on the right to protection of personal data: collective security, general well-being, and respect for public order, 
the Constitution, and the laws. The law applies to both public and private entity data.
In terms of principles, the current law grants people control over their data and the right to request its erasure, consistent with 
the Constitution that enshrines the Habeas Data resource. The law also establishes the obligation to express informed consent 
and the obligation to inform the owner of the data about its processing. There are exceptions to consent when required by 
law, ordered by a court, to prevent harm, among others. In the case of minors, rights are granted according to their progressive 
autonomy. Otherwise, parents or legal representatives can give consent. The law also enshrines the principles of transparency, 
purpose limitation, purpose specification and data minimization. However, there are no mentions of cases where data protection 
or privacy impact assessments are required.
The law makes a special distinction between sensitive data, defined as “personal information whose improper use may give rise to 
discrimination, imply a distinction harmful to human dignity or entail a serious risk for its owner,” and provides a specific list of data that 
will be considered within this category. These data have special treatment and protection considered within the law.
The law details a series of sanctions ranging from a warning and/or a fine to suspension or closure of data records. These sanctions 
are accompanied by various mechanisms for their application and appeal. As for the affected party, the law establishes that the 
owner has the right to rectify, correct, modify and update their personal data when they are inaccurate, incomplete or not updated. 
If the above is not met, the owner may demand compensation for damages.
Although the institutionality of the law has not been fully implemented, the law establishes in its transitional provisions that the 
Minister of Justice must create national control of records, files, archives or personal databases, for which he is responsible and over 
which who exercises maximum supervision for a maximum of one year. Those responsible or in charge of individual records, files, 
archives or databases must declare their existence no later than one year after the creation of national control .
DATA SHARING AND ACCESSIBILITY 
The framework for data exchange in Cuba is distributed in various regulations. On the one hand, Law 149 on Personal Data5 deals with 
the national and international transfer of personal data. In addition, according to information from ECLAC, the current Constitution, 
Decree-Law 335/20156 on the Public Records System of the Republic of Cuba, and Decree-Law 370/20187 on the Computerization 
of Society in Cuba are relevant. In addition, the Digital Transformation Policy and Agenda contemplates actions that contribute 
to achieving a regulatory framework for data management and interoperability. The Personal Data Law authorises data exchange 
within the territory, establishing the mechanisms and those responsible.
Cuba has no open data policy and was ranked 135 out of 195 in the Open Data Inventory8 classification in 2022 with 40 points. 
The above breaks down into 54 out of 100 in coverage and 29 out of 100 in opening. Along these lines, Cuba has not signed the 
international open data charter9.
PROCUREMENT LAWS AND POLICIES 
No policies or laws specifically address acquiring AI systems services or products that incorporate them.

FREEDOM OF INFORMATION LAWS AND ACCESS TO KNOWLEDGE LAWS
The Constitution establishes the right of people to request and receive truthful, objective, and timely information and to access 
information generated by state bodies and entities according to current regulations. However, this right is limited by other laws, 
such as Decree-Law 199, on the security and protection of official information to protect information that, in the government's 
opinion, could be useful for subversive and aggressive plans against the country. 
At the time of the RAM application, the Law on Transparency and Access to Public Information was in the public consultation 
process. This law seeks to generate mechanisms so that citizens can access State data and promote the use of information and 
communication technologies in this area. Thus, this law operationalises the right enshrined in the constitution but also allows 
entities to limit access by carrying out a damage test and examining the advantages and risks of disclosing the data.
PROCEDURAL GUARANTEES AND ACCOUNTABILITY
The Constitution establishes the foundations on which due process is built. Regarding this, since 2021, the Code of Procedures, 
Law 141 of 2021  and Law 143 of 202110, “On the Criminal Procedure”11, Law 151 of the “Penal Code”12 , have established the mechanisms 
and specifications necessary for its application. However, there are no specific elements of AI in the regulatory framework, so there 
is no obligation to report the interaction with an AI system or mechanisms for supervision, compensation or recourse against 
damages caused by AI systems. Along the same lines, regulators or courts have no specific legal basis to request information about 
AI systems and their internal workings.
ONLINE SECURITY AND CONTENT INTEGRITY
Although no policy specifically defines hate speech or disinformation, several regulations address related issues. Along these lines, 
Law Decree 370/201813  on the computerisation of society in Cuba in its article 68, section i) regulates the dissemination of data and 
information contrary to social interest, good customs and the integrity of people, but It does not specify what type of information 
is considered within this. Furthermore, the Regulation of the national action model for responding to cybersecurity incidents14 
contains specific provisions that violate the dignity and individuality of people. Although there is no public evaluation, this law is 
periodically evaluated, and compliance reports are generated.
There are no specific provisions regarding the impact of AI on social media. Decree-Law 35, “On Telecommunications, Information 
and Communication Technologies and the Use of the Radioelectric Spectrum” and Resolution 58, “Regulation for the security and 
protection of personal data in electronic format” of the Ministry of Communications of 24 June 2019, could be applicable, but they 
are not a specific standard.
PUBLIC SECTOR CAPACITY
There is no specific policy for transforming the public sector or training officials. The framework policy in this area is the Comprehensive 
Policy for the Improvement of the Informatization of Society in Cuba, which covers the issue for the country as a whole.

SOCIAL AND CULTURAL DIMENSION
In this section, the social and cultural dimensions are discussed. Social and cultural dimensions are crucial to evaluating ethical 
components in the deployment of AI systems, such as mechanisms to avoid the appearance of biases throughout the life cycle of 
the AI system and the creation of a fair and inclusive AI ecosystem. In this sense, this section addresses topics such as the inclusion 
of women in the development environment of science, technology, engineering, mathematics (STEM) and AI, as well as the 
incorporation of social and cultural diversity to ensure the ethical application of AI. In addition, it includes the level of acceptance 
and attitudes of the general public towards AI, the consideration of environmental and sustainable criteria, health, social well-being 
and culture in creating AI solutions.
DIVERSITY, INCLUSION AND EQUITY
According to the ITU (2022)15, in Cuba, only 73.2% of the population uses the Internet, and only 40.1% of homes have internet. 
Regarding gender, 75.1% of women use the Internet, while only 60.7% of men do so. Based on internal data, the counterpart reports 
that of the total internet population in 2021, 45.6% are men and 54.4% are women. The above shows that the gap favors women, 
contrary to the global trend. In geographical terms, 84.1% of people in urban areas use the Internet, which contrasts sharply with 
only 13.8% in rural areas.
Regarding the gender gap in STEM higher education, 12.16% of men and only 6.15% of women graduate, according to the World 
Economic Forum16 . Specifically, regarding ICT, only 4.31% of men and 1.63% of women. When analysed at the level of children and 
adolescents, no data allows for the evaluation of their performance or expectations by gender. In this regard, the government reports 
its Pre-University Vocational Institute of Exact Sciences, where children and adolescents are prepared to work as professionals in 
exact sciences and in which the proportion of enrollment that corresponds to women is 62.8% while 37.2% are men.
Additionally, Cuba has a National Program for the Advancement of Women, published in Presidential Decree 198 in 202117, with the 
objective of “Promoting the advancement of women and equal rights, opportunities and possibilities [... ], as well as delve into the 
objective and subjective factors that, as expressions of discrimination, persist in Cuban society and hinder greater economic, political, 
social and family results, to eliminate them. The program addresses seven areas of interest: (1) economic empowerment of women, 
(2) media, (3) education, prevention and social work, (4) access to decision-making, (5) legislation and law as a regulatory framework 
for protection against all forms of discrimination and violence, (6) sexual and reproductive health, and (7) statistics and research. 
Policies have not been monitored, but a data observatory on the gender gap was implemented: https://www.genero.onei.gob.cu .
Various initiatives address the urban-rural gap, including the Comprehensive Policy for the Improvement of the Computerization of 
Society in Cuba, Law 145 of Territorial Planning18 and Urban Planning  with its state plan, the New Urban Agenda, and the National 
Territorial Planning Scheme. In addition, a rural revaluation program was approved, which contemplates completing, improving 
and extending connectivity for access to information and communications technologies, internet services, email and electronic 
commerce to the entire rural area, as long as they do not affect national security and defence, as an instrument for improving the 
provision of services, interpersonal relationships and the exchange of knowledge and experiences, and establishing differentiated 
and favourable prices for mobile data packages. To date, no evaluations have been made of these programs.
There are no programs or policies specifically promoting diversity in AI, and there are no obligations regarding the publication of 
statistics related to diversity in any area.

PUBLIC PARTICIPATION AND TRUST
Cuba ranks 170 out of 193 online services ranking (OSI), with just 0.2789 points and 175 out of 193 in the e-participation index (EPI) 
ranking, with just 0.1364 points. In addition to this, Cuba has only 37.5% in the indicator of citizens trust in government applications 
and websites, according to the Inclusive Internet Index (III) (Economist Impact, 2022).

Finally, there is no data on Cubans' trust in AI products and services.

### Page 18

16
ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY POLICIES 
Cuba has no policy addressing AI's environmental impact on the environment or sustainability. Along these lines, there is no specific 
consideration of AI's impact on the use of land and water, an environmental impact assessment is not mandatory for using AI, 
and there is no environmental impact assessment of AI's energy demand and related carbon footprint.
Along these lines, there are only general regulations, such as the Natural Resources and Environment System Law (Law 150/2022)19, 
which establishes the Strategic Environmental Assessment for evaluating the environmental impacts of development policies, plans 
and programs. The Environmental Impact Assessment is used to assess investment projects and determine when they affect the 
population's access to natural resources and the environment in general.
HEALTH AND SOCIAL WELL-BEING
Although there is no specific law on digital health, its aspects are addressed in the Public Health Law20, approved in December 
2023. Along these lines, the approval of digital clinical data is being opened with the introduction of the use of technologies over 
which the Ministry of Public Health has total control. However, the previous law does not explicitly address AI or its impact on the 
mental health of children..
CULTURE
Currently, Cuba does not have policies on using AI to preserve cultural heritage, and, according to the counterpart, since there are 
no indigenous languages, there is no policy in this regard.
There is a policy for preserving cultural heritage: the General Law for the Protection of Cultural Heritage and Natural Heritage21, 
approved in May 2022 and published in the official gazette on September 7, 2023. This law regulates the mechanisms and processes 
for protecting heritage and establishes the rights and obligations of natural and legal persons regarding them.

SCIENTIFIC AND EDUCATIONAL 
DIMENSION
In this section, the scientific and educational dimensions will be discussed. Since scientific and educational components contribute 
significantly to the advancement of AI, assessing them becomes a relevant method to determine a country's readiness for AI 
development. The country's performance in research and innovation (R&I) measures the scientific aspect, including research and 
development (R&D) spending, research production, ethical AI research, and AI innovation production. AI talents. On the other hand, 
the educational aspect is evaluated through the country's performance in educational elements such as educational strategy, 
educational infrastructure, curriculum content, educational achievements, and public access to AI education.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 
According to Statista data (2024)22 , Cuba had R&D spending of 0.52% of GDP in 2020, but there was no granularity in natural sciences 
and engineering. On the other hand, the counterpart complements a publication from the Inter-American and Ibero-American 
Network of Science and Technology Indicators (2024)23 , in which Cuba has an R&D expenditure of 0.32% of GDP in 2021. The above 
translates into low R&D spending as a percentage of GDP compared to world and regional leaders.
In terms of public spending, current expenditures on science and technology from state sources are approximately USD 70.5 
million in 2022, according to the Cuban Statistical Yearbook24 . Although there is no consolidated data on investment related to 
AI, the counterpart also reports two projects with expenditure associated with this topic of 197,722.05 CUP (approx. USD 8,230) in 
2022 and 376,948.43 CUP (approx. USD 15,706) in 2023. In addition, the existence of the National Automatic CTI, Robotics and AI 
Program is reported where the expenditure planning for five years (2020-2025) was 19,237,200 CUP (approx. USD 801,550).
The number of publications per capita on AI and related topics depends on the source and the methodology used to narrow 
down the topic. Although both sources correspond to OpenAlex data when considering different labelling criteria and types of 
publications, the number changes between the Emerging Technology Observatory25 , which reports 0.000014 publications per 
capita, and the National AI Center of Chile, which reports 0.000087 publications per capita. The first reports 0.0135 citations per 
capita, while the second is 0.0027. There is no data on publications in FAccT or, more generally, on ethics.
There are no AI ethics conferences organised in the country. However, some related initiatives are reported, such as IADES (Artificial 
Intelligence Applied to Sustainable Development) 2023, UCIENCIA 2023, and CiberSociedad 2023, where panels on ethics in AI 
have been developed.
In institutional terms, no research centres or departments are dedicated to AI ethics.
In terms of people, according to CENIA data, there are, on average, 155 active researchers per year in AI in Cuba, which translates 
into 0.000014 per capita annually. However, there are no grandmasters on Kaggle.
There are no patents on AI in Cuba. In addition, between 2020 and 2022, there were only 42 GitHub repositories with 582 stars. 
When taken per capita, Cuba has only 3.73 repositories per million inhabitants (0.0000037 per capita).

### Page 20

EDUCATION
Currently, there are no policies or laws governing the use of AI in the education system or the training of teachers and educators 
on the subject.
Regarding infrastructure, the counterpart reports that 42.2% of primary schools and 67.36% of secondary schools have Internet 
access for pedagogical purposes. In terms of connected schools, there are 4,730 general education schools, 181 Diagnostic and 
Guidance Centers, 170 Municipal Education Directorates, and 15 Provincial Education Directorates. The counterpart reports that 
both primary and secondary schools have 100% access to computers for pedagogical purposes, but there is no international data 
to contrast this information.
Only programming teaching is reported at the primary and secondary education levels, but not other elements related to AI, digital 
resilience, computational and critical thinking.
There are no tertiary education programs dedicated to AI in terms of curriculum. The closest is the recently created Bachelor's 
Degree in Data Science 2023 at the University of Havana. In any case, the counterpart reports that courses related to AI are offered 
in computer science-related careers, but no sources corroborate this. Only programming and essential elements of AI are taught 
at a technical-professional level, but nothing related to its ethics.
In quantitative terms, there is only data on graduates in technical sciences or natural sciences and mathematics from the Statistical 
Yearbook of Cuba26, which is 14.4% of enrollment, which, in turn, is only 12.65%. % of the total. There are no specific data for ICT.
The Coursera skills report has no data for Cuba. Moreover, there are no data on PhDs, postdocs, or data science rankings for 
postgraduate degrees.
Finally, regarding public access to AI education, there are no massive open courses, only isolated initiatives. Regarding these, 
the counterpart reports an open course on AI developed with the UNESCO .
office with a scientific dissemination section. It is not suitable for the entire public but for professionals with specific basic knowledge. 
In addition, Joven Club has a course on AI taught in the province of Las Tunas and Holguín, with 17 graduates.

ECONOMIC DIMENSION
 The economic dimension considers relevant aspects within the ecosystem in which AI systems are developed and deployed, such as 
The economic dimension considers relevant aspects within the ecosystem in which AI systems are developed and deployed, such as 
those related to the labour market, intermediate consumption, and AI investment and production. The dynamism and skill level of 
the labour market and spending on intermediate consumption, investment, and production are crucial aspects for assessing the 
performance and readiness of the specific ecosystems in which AI is implemented.
LABOR MARKETS
The absence of data on the percentage of job openings requiring AI-related skills, the current number of employees with data 
science expertise, the relative penetration of AI skills, and the concentration of AI talent is a significant gap. This data is crucial for 
understanding the labour market's readiness for AI implementation. Similarly, the lack of public policies addressing AI's impact on 
the labour market is a notable concern.
INTERMEDIATE CONSUMPTION
In general, there is no required data on intermediate consumption that allows us to know companies' spending on AI services or 
the production of goods and services. As a complement, the counterpart reports that Cuban companies can develop projects for 
which they have the autonomy to allocate budget items at the beginning of each fiscal year. At the end of 2022, the ONEI records 
in its Statistical Yearbook total expenditure on science and technology activities more than 4,785 million CUP (approximately USD 
170.8 million), but its granularity cannot be determined at the AI level.
INVESTMENT AND PRODUCTION
The absence of data on companies' spending on R&D in programming, consulting, and other computer-related activities is a 
significant data gap. This data is crucial for understanding the level of investment in AI development. The information provided by 
the counterpart, from the Statistical Yearbook27 , reports that total expenditure on R&D activities in 2022 is more than 2,281 million 
Cuban pesos (approximately USD 81 million). In the case of the Cuban Software Industry, some 20 million Cuban pesos (approx. 
USD 0.7 million) are recorded as expenses in Research, Development and innovation, of which it is estimated that more than 60% is 
allocated to disruptive technologies (AI, Big Data and Blockchain). Another notable gap is the absence of dataon high technology 
exports in Cuba.

TECHNICAL AND INFRASTRUCTURE 
DIMENSION 
The technical and infrastructure dimensions refer to countries' installed capacity for developing and deploying AI solutions, whether 
through their computing power, the availability of data centres, connectivity, and internet access, among other things. These 
elements are relevant enablers for developing AI systems within a country since they determine development capabilities based 
on the infrastructure available and necessary to support the processed information.
INFRASTRUCTURE AND CONNECTIVITY
According to the ITU28 29 , in Cuba, only 67.4% of the population subscribes to mobile telephony, 42% to active mobile broadband, 
and 3.25% to fixed broadband. This leads to a low average international band of 147 kbits, with no data on average download 
speeds. In terms of connection, only 73.2% have access to the internet, of which 74.3% have access to 3G, but only 49.5% to LTE/
WiMAX and no one to 5G. Furthermore, only 96.2% of the population has electricity access, which is not necessarily permanent.
APPLIED STANDARDS
Cuba does not participate as a member or observer in the relevant normalisation committees30 , nor has it been requested to be 
part of them.
COMPUTATIONAL CAPABILITIES 
Cuba does not have data centres31 32 ; the closest one is 360 km away, in Miami, Florida, USA. Furthermore, there is no specific cloud 
computing policy.
STATISTICAL PERFORMANCE 
International sources do not provide data on Cuba's statistical performance, and laws that establish a global framework for the 
coherent management of data beyond those mentioned in the legal dimension of personal data do not exist.

RAM IMPLEMENTATION
 
Cuba currently lacks an active AI ecosystem or citizen participation around this topic. The Ministry of Communications has initiated 
a process with working groups to develop its ENIA, but it does not include broad and open citizen participation processes.
In line with the above, so that the application of RAM can be used as input in the process, there are no consultation and open 
participation processes. However, it was circulated with government counterparts and experts they considered relevant for review 
and complementation regarding data and political priorities.
Thus, the implementation process of this RAM was carried out in three stages:
1)	
Initial research to gather indicators.
2)	
Sending a pre-filled form with comments and requests to counterparties for its complement.
3)	
Review and consolidate the form for preparing the report and recommendations.
Along these lines, this report's results are based on the data available from international sources and those reported by the official 
counterpart. If there is a discrepancy, all available information is specified and reported.
Despite the above, there is a significant gap in terms of information availability. The report makes this explicit in its sections and 
materialises it in one of the main recommendations in the following section.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Cuba is behind in terms of AI ecosystem and governance development, which means a double challenge: addressing institutionality 
and technological development gaps and developing a roadmap to promote ethical and human rights-respectful use of AI. AI. 
Along these lines, the recommendations presented below point to these two challenges, but they start from previous elements 
that enable an exemplary deployment of AI.

1.	
REGULATION
1.1.	Develop and implement a National AI Strategy.
For the ethical development and use of AI, countries must have a Strategy with concrete actions, measurement mechanisms and 
those responsible for its implementation. This policy should follow the principles and values of the UNESCO recommendation and

### Page 25

23
incorporate multiple stakeholders in its development. Regarding the latter, authorities and public policy makers or academics are 
insufficient; the general public must be considered.
Along these lines, to develop the ENIA, it is recommended that a process that includes open deliberation sessions and public 
consultation with the support and observation of international expert. . Elements such as information given to citizens when 
subjected to AI systems, decision-challenging mechanisms, and guarantees of transparency and accountability to citizens must 
be incorporated.
The development of an ENIA must go beyond AI in the State, addressing mechanisms to promote the private sector, infrastructure 
and human capital development, and mechanisms to safeguard and control abuse of the same public institutions.
In the strategy launched in May 2024, 6 axes and objectives are established, but there are no details about its implementation or the 
specific public policy instruments that will be used. Along these lines, progress must be made in the implementation mechanisms 
and specific actions.
1.2.	Create multi-stakeholder governance with the participation of international observers
One of the weakest elements in the RAM are the digital services indicators (OSI) and electronic participation (EPI). In this line, the ENIA 
should be developed with a robust institutional framework to improve these indicators.
Along these lines, it is recommended that a governance body be created that is made up of people from different sectors of society 
and observers from international organisations. The latter will provide an expert and neutral look at more developed organisations 
and countries in terms of their AI ecosystem and governance.
This body should review the policy's implementation and observe the impacts of technology in general and state initiatives. It must 
also publish open reports on government performance and the use of AI in Cuba.
1.3.	Evaluate the development of an Artificial Intelligence Law
The relevance and need for broad AI regulation must be evaluated. For this, it is relevant to study the risks in the uses of AI and how 
they could be addressed in specific legislation without harming research and innovation in this area.
Along these lines, the systems that will be considered AI and the associated risk levels must be adequately defined. Furthermore, 
principles must be incorporated in specific legislation or an eventual general regulation that covers issues such as proportionality and 
harm, safety and security, equity and non-discrimination, supervision and human decision-making, transparency and explainability, 
and accountability and responsibility.
In an eventual regulation, whether broad or sectoral regulations, the following elements must be addressed:.
	•
Transparency and explainability.
	•
Ethical and legal impact evaluation.
	•
Supervision and accountability mechanisms.
	•
Prohibition of unacceptable uses.
	•
Equity and non-discrimination.
	•
Technical and ethical standard.
Cuba should follow up on existing regulatory experiences and discussions, such as the recently published European law or the 
debate of Chile, Brazil, and Peru laws, among others.
1.4.	Develop regulations for the ethical acquisition of AI systems.
Legislation and public procurement procedures are essential elements for the ethical use of AI. Appropriate procurement 
mechanisms, especially in a country with a large State, can promote good ethical practices that give proper signals to the private 
and academic sectors.
In the RAM, it was seen that there is no specific regulation for the acquisition of AI systems that have adequate elements for their 
correct purchase and operation in the State. Furthermore, these procedures can incorporate UNESCO recommendations and use 
the ethical impact assessment instrument.

### Page 26

24
1.5.	Participation in normalisation and standards organisations related to AI
Currently, Cuba does not participate in any discussion on technical and ethical standards related to AI, such as ISO or EEEI. Along 
these lines, it is recommended to start conversations with organisations to join as observers in the relevant groups (e.g., JTC1) and, 
over time, as full members. The latter applies to having a voice that allows the Cuban reality to be brought to the standards, which 
are usually dominated by the countries of the Global North.
1.6.	Creation of specific guides on the ethical and responsible use of AI in the Cuban context
A relevant problem in using AI, especially when the systems are developed primarily in the Global North, is that they do not 
necessarily adapt to the sociocultural environments of the Global South. Along these lines, it is recommended that use cases that 
require contextual analysis and issue guides be identified for recommendations and ethical use of AI in these areas. When appropriate, 
these guides can be accompanied by databases or specific tools that allow the impact of the systems to be evaluated, calibrated 
and trained appropriately for the Cuban context and audited.
Furthermore, the guides allow for promoting principles and good practices aligned with the UNESCO recommendation without 
necessarily resorting to the formulation of new laws. This allows for greater agility and potential for updating and adaptation.
1.7.	Creation of sectoral policies that incorporate the impact of AI and its responsible use
Currently, Cuba does not participate in any discussion on technical and ethical standards related to AI, such as ISO or EEEI. Along 
these lines, it is recommended to start conversations with organisations to join as observers in the relevant groups (e.g., JTC1) and, 
over time, as full members. The latter applies to having a voice that allows the Cuban reality to be brought to the standards, which 
are usually dominated by the countries of the Global North.
Various areas were detected in which, although AI advances may have a significant impact, no specific policies address them. Along 
these lines, it is recommended to evaluate relevance and develop guidelines for at least the following four areas:
1.7.1.	
Working market
Currently, there are no policies that address the impact of AI on employment. Along these lines, it must be analysed how automation 
through AI can generate unemployment and/or modify existing jobs significantly. Furthermore, the same labour relations and 
required skills change with the emergence of AI-based systems. Cuba should create a policy to address these impacts on the 
labour market.
1.7.2.	
Health
The RAM detects that, although there are general policies that address general health, AI is not addressed as a specific issue. Along 
these lines, given the unique opportunities in the field of health as well as the emerging risks in this area, it is recommended to work 
on a specific sector policy and/or significantly update the existing Public Health policy with a section dedicated to AI.
1.7.3.	
Culture
In the field of culture, AI also presents significant and novel opportunities and risks. On the one hand, the use of AI can foster new 
forms of art in collaboration with AI or facilitate the protection and preservation of existing cultural heritage. However, this same 
technology blurs the limits of what creativity, authorship and the minimum subsistence of a cultural identity means that can be 
lost in the generation of artistic products in an automated way and based on the training of systems. Thus, it is recommended to 
promote a policy that addresses the use of these technologies in the cultural field and promotes safeguards for artists and Cuban 
cultural heritage.
1.7.4.	
Environment
In the environmental field, it must be analysed whether the development of AI in Cuba has a significant impact on the environment. 
If necessary, the development of a regulation that establishes impact evaluations can be discussed.

### Page 27

25
1.8.	Review, evaluation and updating of related legislation
The analysis shows that in several relevant cases, such as the protection of personal data, Cuba has updated legislation that came 
into force a few years ago. However, there are still areas where laws do not necessarily adapt to the impacts and challenges that AI 
brings with it or do not fully align with recommendations on its ethical use.
1.8.1.	
International evaluation of personal data laws, freedom of information and access to knowledge, and online security and 
content integrity.
It is recommended that the laws be evaluated by international experts on the subject and updated according to these reports. 
In particular, some challenges are detected in personal data, freedom of information and access to knowledge, online security, 
and content integrity that could put citizens at risk.
Along these lines, it is recommended that the laws and how they could adequately protect human rights in using digital technologies 
such as AI be subjected to an expert and external evaluation. For example, although the personal data law provides adequate rights 
to individuals, it has exceptions and limitations that should be considered so as not to leave citizens unprotected. 
1.8.2.	
Review and evaluation of the mechanisms and laws that provide procedural guarantees and accountability in the context 
of AI
There is no updated legislation regarding procedural guarantees and accountability that adequately adapts to the use of AI in 
public or private systems. Therefore, it is recommended that existing regulations be reviewed, external evaluations requested and 
updated so citizens have due process when AI systems are involved.
1.9.	Training and certification programs for the public sector
A relevant need revealed from the application of RAM is the lack of training and certification programs for public employees. Along 
these lines, it is necessary to promote the creation of essential technical training courses in the ethical use of AI systems to more 
extensive programs that provide certifications.
It is recommended that training be provided in the application of tools such as UNESCO's Ethical Impact Assessment and audits of 
AI systems, among others. This is not only for the use of technology in the State but also for the correct monitoring and supervision 
of the private sector.
2.	
DATA
2.1.	Improve data collection of the R&D&I ecosystem with a focus on AI 
One of the main gaps detected in this evaluation is the lack of data on the economy, research, innovation, and the labour market 
related to technology. Although the State generates statistics and has its Yearbook, it does not necessarily follow the international 
collection standards that allow their comparison and ensure their quality.
Along these lines, it is recommended that data measurement from the R&D ecosystem be promoted in a granular and transparent 
manner, with the methodologies and databases for the correct construction of baselines made available.
For data collection, it is recommended that standards and manuals such as those of Frascati and Oslo be followed. In addition, it is 
urged to review repositories related to the topic, such as the OECD repositories, to identify the indicators that are not being built 
and the information that is not being collected in the country.
In line with the above, it is recommended that standards be followed and that data be reported to the corresponding international 
organisations (e.g., OECD, World Bank, World Economic Forum, United Nations). This will improve transparency and data quality.
2.2.	Collect specific data from the AI ecosystem.
It is recommended that data collection on the development and use of AI be promoted, mainly in companies. In particular, 
information on spending and adoption in the industry and information on employment and skills required for AI-related positions 
should be collected. To have more disaggregated information, these data must have gender, age, and urban/rural criteria.

### Page 28

26
2.3.	Open data policy
Cuba has no open data policy and has not signed commitments like the Open Data Charter. In line with the two previous actions, 
it is recommended that Cuba acquire commitments to open data and advance a policy that makes it public and available on 
a periodic and transparent basis. It is worth mentioning that it is not enough to publish statistics in a yearbook; we must move 
towards opening databases in machine-readable format33  , with different download options, clear responsible parties, and adequate 
metadata that are kept updated and usable.
2.4.	International consultancies to improve e-participation and digital services indicators 
One of the main gaps detected was in the e-participation (EPI) and digital services indicators (OSI). Along these lines, it is 
recommended to generate a strategy to improve services and e-participation, working on the technological tools that serve 
citizens. Therefore, it is recommended that international organizations conduct consultancies and audits processes and suggest 
improvements. 
3.	
CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT 
3.1.	Priority promotion of policies to improve connectivity
One of the main gaps detected in RAM is access to high-speed internet, electronic devices, and electricity. For an AI strategy to 
be properly implemented and for the technology to effectively mean a positive change for citizens, they have to be able to take 
advantage of it and to do so, they require access through mobile devices and the internet.
Thus, the goal should be to advance Internet access levels, improve upload and download speeds, and facilitate international 
data transfer. For this, connectivity infrastructure must be improved, and policies must be designed to allow households to 
access technology.
As mentioned, speed must also be improved. Thus, work must be done to ensure access to higher-speed networks (4G, 5G). 
3.2.	Rural policy to address the gap in access to electricity and internet
The urban-rural access gap is significant, probably one of the largest in the region. Along these lines, the government should 
prioritise addressing this situation and promoting the connection of rural areas to the Internet.
However, when access is so low, simply deploying connectivity infrastructure is not enough; education and training programs in 
digital technologies must accompany it. If people without access are exposed to the infrastructure and not shown its opportunities, 
change is slower, and the risks of misuse or abuse are more significant.
3.3.	Updating education curricula at all levels
A global challenge to which Cuba is no stranger is updating educational curricula at all levels. This should not be done by focusing 
on technical skills such as programming. Still, work should be done to deliver skills that allow people to adapt to rapid technological 
advances, approach their development, and use them critically.
Along these lines, the primary and secondary school curriculum must incorporate elements such as critical thinking, computational 
thinking, algorithmic thinking, ethics in digital environments, etc.
Along the same lines, work should be done in computer science-related careers to include courses on critical analysis of technologies, 
which allow them to go beyond their development and use and analyse the values involved and the impact of technological 
systems on different stakeholders and how to navigate value tensions in light of the ethical recommendations of UNESCO and 
other international organisations.
Along these lines, it is recommended that tertiary education programs focused on AI incorporate significant components of ethical 
use. This should be done not only at the university level but also at the professional technical level.

### Page 29

27
3.4.	Policy for the use of AI in educational environments
AI not only presents the challenge of teaching its use but can also be used in educational settings to promote learning. There is 
evidence of AI's potential to offer personalised pathways in academic environments and support children's education in more 
creative and adaptive ways. However, if the above is done carelessly, there is a risk of harming learning and children.
On the other hand, the emergence of generative AI puts this technology within reach from a very early age. By being able to interact 
with AI systems through natural language, children and adolescents can use it to support themselves in learning, deepen topics, 
and improve in various areas ranging from writing to programming and art. However, if not appropriately used, interaction with 
generative systems can harm skills by not allowing learning from mistakes and generating false information, among other things.
All of the above requires the generation of a specialised policy on the use of AI in educational environments that allows extracting 
its benefits while protecting people in their learning processes.
3.5.	Training program for teachers and educators on AI and its ethical use
A fundamental need beyond updating the curriculum or a policy for the use of AI in educational environments is the training of 
teachers and educators. If those in charge of leading the learning process are not trained, the rest of the educational policies become 
very difficult to implement and/or may promote bad practices or partial knowledge that harm students.
The government should prioritise teacher training programs in AI and its ethical use so that educational policies around the 
technology are correctly implemented.
3.6.	Support programs for the study of international doctorates in AI
An important gap detected is the country's lack of advanced human capital, which, in turn, translates into a lack of research and 
development. Today, the frontier of technology is not found in the country, so it is recommended to work on a program that allows 
Cubans to travel abroad to obtain doctorates related to both the technical and ethical fields of AI. These programs must have 
adequate incentives and control mechanisms so that people can reintegrate into the Cuban ecosystem and, thus, strengthen it.
Along these same lines, it is recommended that collaboration programs with universities from other countries be established that 
allow the exchange of students and academics in projects related to the development and use of AI.
3.7.	Incentive program for participation in software development spaces such as GitHub and Kaggle
Activity around AI is measured through publications and patents and participation in open software development environments 
such as GitHub or development competitions such as Kaggle. The RAM application revealed meagre participation of Cubans in 
these environments, which shows the need to encourage the country's developers to participate in these instances to contribute 
and improve the area. Along these lines, it is recommended to design an incentive program that promotes this participation.
3.8.	Development of courses open to the general public on basic concepts of AI and its ethical use
AI is a general-purpose technology found in various areas of people's daily lives. Therefore, the general population must have basic 
knowledge of interacting with AI systems responsibly and safely. Consequently, it is recommended that massive and free courses 
on AI, its applications, and its ethical and safe use be developed.
3.9.	Increase AI R&D spending
Although the data does not allow us to identify specific spending on R&D in AI, it can be seen that R&D spending in general is low 
in Cuba. Along these lines, it is recommended that the state increase investment in R&D and focus primarily on AI to develop it as 
a critical sector for the economy and public use in Cuba.
It is recommended that funds be created focused on basic research and AI technology transfer. These can promote research and 
development both locally and in collaboration with universities and companies outside the country.
3.10..	
Increase AI R&D spending
One key component for developing AI systems that adapt to local reality is data. Along these lines, it is recommended to create 
open repositories for the training of Cuban systems in different industrial and government sectors. These repositories are complex 
and must be evaluated and audited periodically by international experts to review potential biases that could harm users of the 
systems trained in them..

### Page 30

3.11.	
Promote entrepreneurship in AI
In this evaluation, an ecosystem of ventures related to AI or private investment in this area was not detected. It is recommended that 
innovation and entrepreneurship in the private sector be promoted in an environment open to potential international investments 
and with an adequate regulatory framework for this.
Table 2 summarizes the recommendations made based on the report's results, along with their priority to advance the 
implementation of UNESCO principles that promote the development and ethical use of AI in Cuba.
