The world is now set to change at a pace not seen in decades, even \ncenturies. Al-based tools and applications make our lives easier, smoother, and richer. They help us move efficiently, get informed, \nget credit, get a job, and get our taxes done. \nBut in its current form, Al reproduces and amplifies many of the social challenges we face. It is not acceptable that around a third \nof the world's population still lacks adequate internet access. Upstream, the Al industry is highly concentrated, with just two \ncountries - the United States and China - and a dozen companies accounting for a major share of the sector. This can lead only \nto greater inequality of outcomes - including gender disparities - downstream. Non-diverse Al teams, unrepresentative datasets, \nand opaque and biased algorithms can cause harm, particularly to those who are already vulnerable, whether compani",
