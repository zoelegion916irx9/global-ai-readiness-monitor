Left ungoverned, AI risks \ndeepening inequalities, eroding privacy, and undermining \nthe very rights that define our shared humanity. In this \npivotal moment, UNESCO’s Recommendation on the \nEthics of Artificial Intelligence unanimously adopted \nby all 193 Member States in 2021 stands as a global \ncompass, guiding nations to harness AI’s potential while \nsafeguarding human dignity, equity, and sustainability. \nMalaysia has emerged as a regional leader in answering \nthis call. Through its steadfast commitment to ethical AI governance, the country exemplifies \nhow innovation can coexist with inclusivity. Central to this effort is Malaysia’s proactive \nembrace of UNESCO’s Readiness Assessment Methodology (RAM), a participatory tool that \nempowers nations to diagnose strengths, address gaps, and chart pathways for responsible \nAI. \nRAM goes beyond a prescriptive checklist; it is a country-led consultative process designed \nto identify institutional strengths, regulatory gaps, and policy opportunities. It offers context \nspecific, evidence-based guidance across five key dimensions: legal and policy frameworks; \ndata and digital infrastructure governance; education and research ecosystems; economic \nand labour market capacity; and societal inclusion and awareness. The RAM process \nin Malaysia reflects a pioneering vision. Over 300 stakeholders from 28 government \nministries and agencies, 9 higher education institutions, 9 key industries, and 10 relevant \nassociations participated in vibrant consultations. Government agencies underscored the \nurgency of strengthening ",
