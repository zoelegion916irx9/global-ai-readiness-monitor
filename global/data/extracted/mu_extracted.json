The world is now set to change at a pace not seen in decades, even \ncenturies. AI-based tools and applications make our lives easier, smoother, and richer. They help us move efficiently, get informed, \nget credit, get a job, and get our taxes done.\n \nBut in its current form, AI reproduces and amplifies many of the social challenges we face. It is not acceptable that around a third \nof the world’s population still lacks adequate internet access. Upstream, the AI industry is highly concentrated, with just two \ncountries – the United States and China – and a dozen companies accounting for a major share of the sector. This can lead only \nto greater inequality of outcomes – including gender disparities – downstream. Non-diverse AI teams, unrepresentative datasets, \nand opaque and biased algorithms can cause harm, particularly to those who are already vulnerable, whether companies or \nindividuals, children and young people, women, or entire democracies.\n \nThat is why UNESCO drafted the Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, which was adopted in 2021 by 193 \ncountries to make sure AI delivers fair, sustainable, and inclusive outcomes. The Recommendation is based on the protection and \npromotion of human rights, human dignity, and environmental sustainability, and these values are then translated into principles \nsuch as accountability, transparency, and pri",

      "text": "The Ministry of Youth Empowerment, Sports and Recreation should prime itself for the increasingly relevant role that AI plays in the sports sector. Although this is generally ignored in current AI development discussions, key areas of AI relevance in Sports include sports science (e.g using computer vision to analyse player movement and enhance injury prevention actions), enhancing athletes performance through big data analytics of gaming strategies and performance trends, doping detection, sport equipment design, E-sports and gaming, and the sports betting industry. A good starting point is innovation (whether in adoption or creation of local solutions) and the preparedness to tackle the risks it poses – not the least of which is contextual adaptability in a sector that is heavily designed for maximising social human interactions. 29 Action 2a: Discuss policies and/or regulations as part of an updated national AI strategy. Time frame for this is estimated to be 3 months with the process to be driven by MITCI. Action 2b: Review sector-based progress of the existing strategy and propose corrective measures based on recent learnings. Redefine priority sectors as needed based upon the evolution of the Mauritian economy and the updated socioeconomic contexts highlighted above. Time frame to achieve this review is estimated to be 6 months and to be driven by the METC. B. INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORKS The NCF discussions noted that in light of the pervasive nature of AI technologies and the ever increasing risks that they pose, there is need for strategic and institutional leadership to boost public and private sector leaders’ capabilities to harness AI’s potential, strengthen collaboration between government ministries and agencies to deliver strategically on AI-related initiatives, manage the AI hype, and foster a support environment for ethical AI research.

Action 8: Implement the proposals set out above to close the AI skills gap. To be led by the Ministry of Education, with the support of MITCI, METC and MDPA. Time frame is 2 years. 9. DATA: ADDRESS THE DATA GAP Most AI applications, specifically ML and deep learning algorithms, rely critically upon data to produce targeted results. Inadequate, poor quality, and biased data are well-known challenges in building ethical AI systems. This issue is global but is compounded by peculiar factors in Mauritius. For example, while a significant number of datasets are available as part of the open dataset repository managed by the MDPA, the breadth of data available, usually government-based data, could be viewed as limited for purposes of advanced analytics. Hence, there is a need to augment or supplement with data from other sources, but data merging between different dataset technologies is a recurrent challenge that can inhibit creation of beneficial datasets. Furthermore, many organisations either do not have enough data or have data that is not available in machine-readable formats. Although e-government initiatives have begun, many private and public institutions have historically relied on paper-based data. Thus, for applications requiring long series data, converting paper-based data to digital formats will require substantial efforts and resources. Action 9: Improve capability to capture and generate datasets whilst promoting data engineering and improving data scientists’ skill sets. To be conducted by MDPA in collaboration with academic institutions. Timeframe is 1 year. 34 The table ",
