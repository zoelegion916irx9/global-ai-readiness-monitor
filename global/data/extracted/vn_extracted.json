This journey began with the following key milestones: • Resolution No. 52-NQ/TW issued by the Politburo in 2019, on guidelines and policies to proactively participate in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. This Resolution identifies AI as one of six priority technology groups. The State will provide support mainly through institutional innovation and improvement, the creation of a favourable business environment, investment in infrastructure, human resource development, science and technology development, and public procurement. • On the basis of Resolution No. 52-NQ/TW, the Prime Minister successively issued Decision No. 2289/QD-TTg dated 31 December 2020 (promulgating the National Strategy on the Fourth Industrial Revolution to 2030) and Decision No. 127/QD-TTg dated 26 January 2021 (promulgating the National Strategy on Research, Development, and Application of Artificial Intelligence to 2030). • Decision No. 127/QD-TTg sets the goal that by 2030 Viet Nam will become a centre of innovation and the development of strong AI application solutions. This Decision assigns responsibilities to 15 ministries, one ministerial-level agency, and one government agency, with the MST serving as the focal point to lead the organization, implementation, and consolidation of the Strategy’s implementation progress. In addition to Decision No. 127/QD-TTg on the overarching Strategy, policies on building digital data and digital human resources to serve AI development have also been addressed in a series of other policy decisions, such as Decision No. 749/QD-TTg of the Prime Minister dated 3 June 2020 approving the “National Digital Transformation Programme to 2025, with O",

From a legal perspective, the general principle of gender equality has been clearly and consistently recognized in the 2013 Constitution and the 2006 Law on Gender Equality, and it has also been mainstreamed into laws related to the fields of science and technology, information and communications, and electronic transactions, such as the 2008 Law on High Technology, the 2013 Law on Science and Technology, the 2023 Law on Electronic Transactions, and the 2023 Law on Telecommunications.

Across all pillars, the Relevance pillar had the highest index thanks to progress in open data policies and the value of digital finance.40 According to the “Digital in the Time of Covid” report by Tufts University (US) in 2020, Viet Nam ranked 3rd in the Attitude pillar among the evaluated countries and territories.

Additionally, the professional qualifications of IT personnel are impressive, with 86% of Viet Nam’s IT workforce holding a university or college degree, of which around 7.5% hold a master’s degree.104 However, the number of highly specialized AI professionals in Viet Nam remains scarce, with roughly 5,000 AI engineers, 7,000 AI specialists, and personnel in approximately 500 AI startups.105,106 Compared to current labour market demand, the number of professionals with AI expertise remains significantly insufficient. Viet Nam faces a substantial shortage of IT personnel, estimated at approximately 150,000 to 200,000 IT engineers annually during the 2022–2025 period.107 This shortage is evident in the labour market, as AI engineers are among the most difficult IT positions for enterprises to recruit.108 The scarcity has led to higher salaries for AI personnel compared to the general IT workforce. The average salary for IT personnel is VND 43.7 million per month.109 Among enterprises, 43.7% are willing to pay AI personnel 10–20% more than other IT positions, while 18.4% are willing to pay 20–50% higher salaries for AI personnel.110 Figure 8: IT workforce demand and shortage in Viet Nam, 2022–2025 530,000 550,000 650,000 700,000 150,000 150,000 170,000 200,000 2022 2023 2024 2025 IT workforce demand and shortage in Viet Nam, 2022–2025 Demand Shortage Source: TopDev, 2025 The shortage is being partially offset by the numb",
