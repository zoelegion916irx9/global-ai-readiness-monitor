      "text": "REGULATION This section includes recommendations based on the gaps identified in the legal section of the RAM, the discussions held with different stakeholders during the participatory sessions, and the legal initiatives currently being discussed in Chile. The recommendations include both legal and regulatory actions for the short and medium term, including the responsible institutions for their implementation. Assign urgency to the updating of the Personal Data Protection Law and the Cybersecurity and Information Critical Infrastructure Bill The safeguarding of personal data is regarded as a fundamental element in ensuring the effective adherence to the principles and values outlined in UNESCO’s Recommendations. The diagnostic process conducted during the implementation of the RAM raised concerns about the outdated nature of Chile’s current legislation concerning the protection of personal data. Furthermore, ensuring a secure digital ecosystem for the development and ethical use of AI requires addressing cybersecurity threats and treating information as a critical infrastructure. In this regard, two pieces of legislation currently being discussed in parliament should be given urgent priority. The first is the bill that regulates the protection and processing of personal data and creates the Personal Data Protection Agency (bulletins 11144-07 and 11092-07, currently in its third constitutional process). Chile has signed international commitments to update this law, which is vital for ensuring an adequate protection of people’s rights against potential risks in digital environments. The second legislation is the Framework Law on Cybersecurity and Critical Information Infrastructure (bulletin 14847-06, in the second constitutional process), which creates the National Cybersecurity Agency with regulatory, supervisory and sanctioning powers for state agencies and private institutions. This piece of legislation is necessary for the deployment of tools and AI systems digi",

Technical and Ethical Standards: Standards that companies and organisations must adhere to when developing and using AI systems. 7. Creation of an independent body responsible for issuing guidelines and best practices, monitoring and auditing assessments and ensuring overall compliance with the law. In the context of establishing this organisation, it is advisable to initiate discussions with both the legislative branch and the public regarding the importance and specifics of a particular AI bill. To inform these discussions, a comprehensive study should be conducted to examine how AI regulation is evolving in the European Union, the United States, China and other countries that have made significant progress in this area. This analysis should pay particular attention to how these countries are implementing the principles outlined in the UNESCO Recommendation. It is worth noting that global practices vary, with some countries employing specialised agencies, ministries, public-private partnerships, and other approaches. Therefore, we must carefully consider the most suitable approach for Chile’s specific circumstances. Responsible Institutions: MSTKI Timeframe: 2023 – 2024 Explore Regulatory Experimentation Mechanisms (e.g., Sandboxes) for the Application of AI in Critical Areas Regulation can arrive late in rapidly developing technological fields, such as AI, and can increase the costs of innovation if it is overregulated. Therefore, It is recommended to promote regulatory experimentation initiatives which allow for the creation of controlled and secure environments in which companies and organisations can test and refine AI solutions with a certain degree of regulatory certainty. Among the different possibilities for regulatory experimentation, the sandbox has garnered more experience in the Latin American context, as years of experience have been accumulated in Colom",

      "text": "Table 5. Example cases of Sandboxes The OECD (2023c) defines regulatory sandboxes as a specific regulatory experimentation tool in which flexibility or waivers are set in place for firms to test new systems with reduced requirements. Sandboxes include mechanisms to protect users and, since they closely connect firms and officials from governing bodies, can also inform policy development. Some characteristics of sandboxes are their temporary nature, trial-and-error approach and collaboration between multiple stakeholders. However, there is no one specific definition nor shape that sandboxes take since they are very context-dependent. Some examples of sandboxes that can inform and inspire the Chilean case are: • Brazil: Recently, the Brazilian National Data Protection Authority opened a call for proposals to create a regulatory sandbox to increase algorithmic transparency, foster AI responsible innovation and inform AI regulation (ANPD, 2023). • Colombia: The government created a supervised space where firms can develop AI tools that are privacy preserving. The sandbox provides a collaborative environment which facilitates testing tools to achieve privacy standards (SIC, 2021). • Korea: A group of four ministries related to economy, science and technology created a sandbox that can provide regulatory waivers to test products, services and business models. While tests are conducted, the data informs government regulation. Since 2019, the sandboxes expanded into special regulation-free zones for some specific sectors and applications (Fintech Center Korea, 2023). Promote ethical principles of AI through purchasing regulations and standards The RAM, in its assessment, highlighted the importance of creating administrative guidelines for procuring data science and AI projects within the public sector as a best practice. Leveraging procurement regulations can be a highly efficient way to integrate key elements of the UNESCO Recommendation in a dynamic manner. With the immin",

      "text": "Utilise soft regulations and guidelines for the adoption of ethical principles in AI systems Since changing existing laws often require lengthy discussions, it is recommended to explore the use of soft-regulations such as the use of rules and directives that can guide the public and private sector in the use of ethical principles in AI systems. Such principles include: proportionality, safety and protection, equity and non-discrimination, human oversight and decision-making, transparency and explainability, as well as accountability and responsibility. Drawing from successful national precedents, it is suggested to contemplate the use of instruments such as presidential guidelines to steer the adoption of ethical principles in the deployment of AI systems within government agencies. The establishment of these guidelines within the public sector could serve as a valuable model for applying these principles across various domains. To promote the sharing of knowledge and the dissemination of lessons learned during its implementation, it is recommended to systematically document and publicise both the process and the outcomes of this experience.

This platform should incorporate mechanisms for contact, participation, and citizen engagement, facilitating an ongoing relationship between institutional bodies and the broader local AI community. Responsible Institutions: MSTKI, DGD and the Government Laboratory. Timeframe: 2024 - 2025 Development of AI Strategies for Local Governments AI strategies primarily focus on national-level developments, presenting significant challenges at the local government level. Conversely, developing AI systems with an emphasis on local communities provides an opportunity to extend AI beyond major cities. It is recommended to formulate AI strategies at the municipal level, following the lead of cities such as Barcelona or Helsinki. To achieve this, given the heterogeneous nature of municipalities, they should commence by evaluating their preparedness to establish a baseline for reference. Considering that this measure remains relatively novel due to limited comparative experience, it is advisable to collaborate with international organisations to facilitate research and pilot development funding in rural local governments. Responsible Institutions: MSTKI and Undersecretariat of Administrative and Regional Development (SUBDERE, by its name in Spanish). Timeframe: 2024-2026. Update Chile’s National AI Policy (NAIP) and Action Plan Although AI governance and institutional structures are robust, NAIP does not explicitly incorporate UNESCO’s Recommendation principles. Therefore, it is recommended to revise the current NAIP to include these principles and any new initiatives arising from this integration. These updating initiatives and recommendations should be formulated based on the findings during the implementation of the RAM and the respective participation sessions conducted within the same context. In particular, the Axis 3 of the NAIP, which deals with Ethics, Regulatory Aspects and Socioeconomic Impacts of AI, should ",

      "text": "Update the institutional framework and governance of the NAIP It is recommended to propose a new institutional formula within the national policy with the explicit mandate to implement the NAIP, oversee its degree of implementation and define evaluation mechanisms. The international experience showcases various models, including specialised agencies, ministries and public-private consortia, among others. Considering the current Chilean institutional framework, strengthening the existing governance led by MSTKI and formalising the Inter Ministerial Committee with greater faculties than sporadic consultations is suggested. Additionally, studying the formation of a permanent multi-stakeholder body for the development of recommendations on the ethical use of AI is recommended. This body could consist of actors from the public sector, industry, academia and civil society with an advisory role and the dissemination of best practices. Furthermore, this body can support the promotion and dissemination of public processes that require greater citizen participation. Responsible Institution: MSTKI. Timeframe: Last quarter of 2023 and 2024. Create early assessment mechanisms for the implementation of the NAIP Despite Chile having a wide range of ongoing programs for AI development, it still lacks tracking mechanisms to assess the effectiveness of these measures. Based on the findings from the application of the RAM, it is recommended to establish indicators and mechanisms for monitoring and evaluating the Action Plan and the NAIP. Considering the existing instruments in the country, the use of instances such as the Management Improvement Programme (PMG, by its name in Spanish) is recommended to report the fulfilment of committed actions within the public sector. Additionally, collaboration with multilateral organisations to fund the piloting of evaluation and measurement tools for compliance with these initiatives is recommended. It is suggested to include a compliance report f",

Consider reassessing compensation structures for funding instruments that support advanced human capital development. This revision should aim to facilitate international collaboration networks and prevent experts from returning without suitable academic or industry positions. d. Promote Integration of Ph.D. Holders into the Industry: Design, pilot, and implement measures to encourage the integration of Ph.D. holders into the industry, with a particular focus on information technologies, including AI. This may involve initiatives such as tax incentives for companies hiring Ph.D. holders, establishing collaborative Ph.D. programs with industry partners, and offering funding for research internships in the industry, among other strategies. e. Allocate Resources for Industry-University Collaboration: Allocate industry-university collaboration funds to support the digital transformation of industries through the application of AI. Prioritise industries with the most significant gaps in digitalization or those where AI implementation promises the highest productivity gains. f. Attract international conferences on AI: One of the gaps identified during the application of RAM is the absence of relevant international conferences on AI or AI ethics in the national territory. Therefore, it is recommended to provide funding to attract and organise high-level conferences on AI and its ethics in the country. g. Evaluate the Digital Transformation Strategy in Education: Monitor and assess the outcomes of the current Digital Transformation strategy in education to gauge its effectiveness and relevance in building human capital for AI. Based on these evaluations and lessons learned, consider the establishment of specific laws or policies related to the use of AI in the education system. h. Collect and Maintain",

Responsible Institutions: Ministry of Environment, MSTKI, and MEDT. Timeframe: 2024 and 2025 Assess the impact of AI and automation on the workforce and define job retraining plans The Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare has initiated a forward-looking process and established a multi-stakeholder working group to address the future of work. To ensure a smooth transition for workers whose roles are impacted by the introduction of AI tools, it is recommended to expedite and enhance these efforts. Specific measures should be devised in the short term to support affected workers, which may include updates to regulations, considering changes in the working relationship between employees and employers, as well as the allocation of funds to assist individuals in their transition and retraining. Simultaneously, alongside the forward-looking discussions, it is advisable to foster a multi-stakeholder dialogue and establish a national cross-sector agreement on the responsible and ethical use of AI. This agreement should outline principles and commitments from all involved parties, signifying a significant milestone where industry, academia, the public sector, and civil society come together to endorse these principles. Subsequently, guidelines for ethical algorithm use within businesses should be developed, with incentives created to encourage companies to adopt or develop these guidelines as part of their ethical codes. Furthermore, in the context of training and certification, it is essential to broaden the public offerings of AI training. This expansion should encompass modules addressing the ethical and responsible use of AI. Additionally, qualifications frameworks should be reinforced by integrating AI-related topics into the Information Technologies training and employment route. Responsible Institutions: Minist",

These guides should cover, at a minimum, best practices related to topics such as citizen participation processes, benefit allocation, alert systems and process automation. Additionally, it is advisable to explore the establishment of a certification system for AI solution providers serving the public sector. Responsible Institutions: SUBDERE, DGD, Government Laboratory. Timeframe: 2025-2026. Creation of a Working Group to Assess the Impact of AI on Culture The application of RAM in Chile has highlighted a noticeable absence of the use and measurement of AI in this field. It is recommended to establish a working group that will produce a report on the potential impact of AI, especially in the context of generative AI, on culture and the creative industries. Based on the content of this report, proposals for actions are expected to be developed for the training and retraining of stakeholders in the cultural ecosystem, as well as for fostering new developments using technological tools. It is suggested to discuss methods of regulatory experimentation in the field of culture, addressing the challenge of new intellectual property regimes that align with international agreements in this area. Considering the lack of data in this area during the implementation of RAM, it is recommended to study the opportunities and impacts of AI systems on the preservation of the country’s cultural heritage and to develop a roadmap to leverage the potential of AI and establish recommendations to protect it from potential harm.
