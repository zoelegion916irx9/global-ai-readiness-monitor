Government agencies should lead by providing high-quality open government data in standardized, machine-readable formats to enhance accessibility for AI training and research. The framework must prioritize the reuse of non-personal and anonymized datasets under strong privacy and ethical safeguards. Beyond the public sector, data-sharing mechanisms should be established to encourage private sector participation through incentive structures and risk-governance model that balance competitive interests with the protection of individual rights.

Given that AI systems often rely on personal data to make predictions or decisions, clear legal pathways for objections are essential to safeguard individual autonomy and build public trust. Additionally, individuals should be able to challenge and appeal automated outcomes that significantly affect them, especially when they affect critical areas such as public services, credit, employment, or education. These rights would strengthen public accountability and ensure that AI systems respect fairness, transparency, and due process.

This framework should outline clear criteria for assessing AI risks to fundamental rights, safety, fairness, and transparency, and offer practical tools for both public and private sector developers to evaluate their systems throughout the AI lifecycle. The framework should initially focus on high-impact or high-risk use cases, such as AI systems used in healthcare, law enforcement, finance, education, and critical public services—where errors, bias, or lack of oversight could result in significant harm to individuals or society. For high-risk AI systems, policymakers should also consider requiring insurance or liability coverage schemes to ensure adequate compensation in cases of harm, especially when legal responsibility cannot be clearly assigned. While the framework should not impose unnecessary regulatory burdens on low-risk innovation, it should strongly encourage risk-based self-assessment, documentation, and transparency practices for any AI system that affects human decision-making or public trust. The framework can be integrated into existing regulatory sandboxes, procurement processes, or audit mechanisms to ensure responsible AI deployment. Timeline: 2025-2026 Priority: High",

However, the committee’s considerations focus only on technical feasibility and financial efficiency, while neglecting the ethical implications and potential impacts of AI on human rights. Additionally, there are currently no guidelines in Thailand for evaluating human rights risks during AI procurement, leading to an increase in the deployment of opaque systems in public services. 68 142 “Me-Handbook,” accessed April 29, 2025, http://web.undp.org/evaluation/documents/handbook/me-handbook.pdf. 143 “Demystifying the M&E Framework: A Guide for Effective Evaluation,” EvalCommunity (blog), accessed April 29, 2025, https://www.evalcommunity.com/career-center/me-framework/. 144 “Introduction to Monitoring and Evaluation: The Basics,” EvalCommunity (blog), https://www.evalcommunity.com/career-center/monitoring-and-evaluation-basics/. In comparison to international practices, such as the United Kingdom, having AI procurement guidelines is essential for public agencies. This guideline could assist agencies in evaluating their AI needs by providing clear instructions and recommendations for acquiring AI systems. It can also emphasize the importance of ethical considerations in the procurement process aligning with UNESCO’s Ethical Impact Assessment, ensuring a responsible evaluation of suppliers and the adoption of AI technologies that serve the public’s best interests.

Even though the National AI Strategy’s annual report provides a broad overview of each strategy achievement. It does not specify more details about the plan’s evaluations, limitations, or challenges in the implementation phase. As a result, the annual report does not serve as an effective measure for assessing the plan’s implementation. To effectively assess the implementation of the plan, adopting a Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) mechanism is essential. M&E is a systematic process that enables organizations to measure the performance, effectiveness, and impact of programs, projects, or policies. Monitoring ensures activities align with objectives, identifying inefficiencies and delays, while evaluation provides deeper analysis of relevance, efficiency, and outcomes to determine whether goals have been achieved.142 A robust M&E framework typically includes key performance indicators (KPIs), data collection methods, reporting structures, and feedback loops, supporting informed decision-making and continuous improvement.143 It enhances transparency, accountability, and strategic planning, ensuring initiatives remain effective and aligned with their intended purpose.144 Thailand should establish an M&E mechanism to assess the effectiveness of the National AI Strategy, ensuring that its implementation is data-driven and results-oriented. This would provide a structured approach to evaluating real performance, optimizing resources, and maintaining efficiency and accountability. The National AI Committee could serve as the primary agency responsible for M&E, overseeing execution and driving the strategy forward while ensuring its alignment with national objectives.

To ensure AI systems developed or deployed in Thailand are safe, trustworthy, and internationally interoperable, the country must urgently adapt its NQI to be AI-ready and simultaneously establish a dedicated infrastructure for AI testing. This involves: • Upgrading Accreditation Systems: Ensure that existing accreditation mechanisms are capable of certifying laboratories and conformity assessment bodies (CABs) specifically for AI-related evaluations, including fairness, explainability, and robustness testing. • Expanding CAB Capabilities: Promote the development and recognition of Thai CABs that can perform AI-specific conformity assessments, covering both algorithmic behavior and data governance. • Adapting Metrology and Standardization: Equip Thailand’s national metrology and standardization systems with the tools and expertise to measure and validate AI-specific indicators, including performance benchmarking and probabilistic outputs. • Establishing AI Testing Facilities: Build dedicated infrastructure for AI system testing. These facilities would simulate real-world conditions and evaluate AI systems prior to deployment, especially in high-risk sectors like healthcare, mobility, and public administration. • Market Surveillance for AI: Leverage existing market surveillance mechanisms and adapt them for continuous monitoring of AI systems post-deployment, to detect systemic risks or violations of standards.

Current initiatives mainly focus on technical competencies such as programming, data science, and machine learning. However, ethical, societal, and governance aspects of AI remain significantly underrepresented in curricula, and early assessments indicate a persistent skills gap, particularly in aligning education outcomes with labor market demands. Coordination between educational institutions and industry also remains limited. To build a comprehensive and future-proof education system, it is critical to expand the curriculum across all levels— from K-12 to higher education—to systematically incorporate AI literacy, ethics, and responsible innovation. Students must not only learn how to build AI systems, but also understand how to design, deploy, and manage AI technologies in a safe, fair, and socially responsible manner. In this time of major technological revolution, the education system should be revisited along two parallel tracks, to actively foster youth’s intellectual immunity in the face of misinformation, disinformation, and technological solutionism: (i) integrating specific AI-focused contents that tackle all dimensions (technical and sociocultural); and (ii) enhancing the quality of the teaching and learning methods in the existing disciplines and subject matters that develop critical and creative thinking, such as humanities, social studies, and civic education. In parallel, teacher training and certification programs should be developed to equip educators with the skills needed to teach AI concepts effectively, including both technical and ethical dimensions.

While some upskilling and reskilling initiatives have been introduced by both public and private sectors, participation remains 71 uneven, especially among workers in informal employment or SMEs. Without stronger incentives, large segments of the workforce risk being left behind in the digital transition. To accelerate human capital development, the government should implement labor incentives that encourage upskilling and reskilling, especially in AI and digital domains. These could include tax deductions or subsidies for companies that invest in employee training, as well as stipends or learning credits for individuals who pursue certified courses.

      "text": "Unlocking Green Energy for Sustainable Data Center Expansion A major barrier for expanding green and energy-efficient data centers in Thailand is the limited availability of renewable energy production. While global tech investors increasingly require green energy sources for their data centers, Thailand’s current renewable energy capacity remains insufficient to meet growing demand. To address this, the government should accelerate investments in solar, wind, and hydropower projects, focusing on scaling up production capacity. Initiatives such as Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) and green energy bonds could be explored to fund large-scale renewable energy infrastructure. Furthermore, regulatory support is needed to open direct Power Purchase Agreements (Direct PPA) and enable Third Party Access (TPA) for electricity supply. Currently, private sector entities cannot directly supply power to data centers, 75 limiting renewable energy adoption. By allowing direct PPA and third-party grid access, clean energy producers could supply electricity directly to data centers, bypassing current regulatory constraints. This change would enable more sustainable data center expansion and facilitate broader AI deployment. Additionally, microgrids and distributed energy generation in rural areas should be supported to localize green power, enhancing the sustainability and reliability of energy supplies for edge and modular data centers across Thailand.

      "text": "Elevate Thailand’s R&D Investment to 2.5 percent of GDP by 2030 According to UNCTAD, share of AI in frontier technology market in 2023 is at 7 percent, which projects to increase to 29 percent in ten years. The forecast represents the importance of increasing the size of the AI market as well as corporate and private sector R&D spending, to keep up with the global trend. Currently, Thailand ranked is not outstanding in Global Innovation Index (ranked by the World Intellectual Property Organization). In 2024, its rank in human capital and research is at 71 among 133 countries reflecting the low proportion of R&D spending on innovation development. However, the country has a high innovation output relative to its innovation input, reflecting efficient resource utilization and indicating a strong potential for Thailand’s research to thrive. Thailand’s current R&D expenditure at 1.21 percent of GDP in 2024 while the percentage share in GDP of R&D decreases from 2023, it shows a rising trend since 2013 indicating the upward trend of the R&D spending in the country. However, the proportion of R&D remains low, ranked 34 among 133 countries. To enhance its competitiveness and foster economic growth, Thailand should aim to increase its R&D spending to 2.5 percent of GDP by 2030, with a dedicated sub-allocation of 0.5–0.7 percent of GDP for AI-specific research and innovation. This target aligns with the OECD average and positions Thailand to better compete with other nations in the region. Thailand remains primarily an importer of AI technology, positioning itself more as a user than a developer. As such, increasing investment in AI R&D may initially appear counterintuitive. However, it is crucial that the country allocate research funding strategically to areas where it can add the most value. Rather than focusing on foundational model development, Thailand should emphasize applied research aimed at optimizing and contextualizing AI technologies. It could focus its research",

This includes exploring the possibility of introducing a specific exception under the Copyright Act for non-commercial TDM uses, particularly for research, education, and public-interest innovation. In parallel, Thailand should consider fair and balanced models for commercial TDM activities, including appropriate remuneration or licensing mechanisms to protect rights holders while enabling innovation. Simultaneously, strengthening patent guidelines for AI is necessary to address emerging challenges in AI-related inventions. Updated guidelines would provide clarity on how AI innovations are protected, setting clear criteria for novelty, technical application, and the use of training datasets in patent claims. This would create legal certainty, incentivize innovation, and protect intellectual property rights in the evolving AI landscape. Timeline: 2025–2028 Priority: Medium",

      "text": "Developing Regulatory Sandbox for AI Innovation A Regulatory Sandbox should provide a supervised framework where AI applications can be deployed under temporary regulatory flexibility, allowing authorities to evaluate legal, ethical, and societal implications before broader adoption, this will ensure that there would be no adverse effects for the technology before commercialized. One illustrative example is the case of autonomous vehicles (AVs). These systems raise complex regulatory questions around liability, data protection, algorithmic transparency, and road safety. A regulatory sandbox would allow AV developers to conduct limited trials, such as geo-fenced testing zones or designated public routes, under close regulatory supervision. This enables policymakers to observe system behavior, assess potential harm, and consult with affected stakeholders, such as insurers, city authorities, and pedestrians, before enacting permanent rules. Such an approach reduces the risk of premature or overreaching regulation while supporting evidence-based policymaking. The sandbox model can be applied across other high-risk AI use cases, such as AI in health diagnostics, credit scoring, or predictive policing, where real-world data is essential for understanding how algorithmic decisions impact individual rights and social systems. By institutionalizing this mechanism, Thailand can improve regulatory agility, foster trust in AI innovation, and ensure that its legal frameworks evolve in step with technological change.
