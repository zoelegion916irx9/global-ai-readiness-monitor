The Uruguayan political sector and public opinion are increasingly concerned about the effects of deep fakes, particularly when 2024 is an electoral year. In late 2023 and early 2024, large technology companies have adopted standards of self-regulation to provide watermarking systems for various forms of AI-generated content. Supporting these international approaches and participating in these processes, coupled with local interventions in national media environments and comprehensive digital citizenship programs and campaigns, is essential to address these concerns. 13",

The latter, operating under the Presidency of Uruguay, is overseeing the review of the AI Strategy and the development of the first National Data Strategy, receiving technical support from CAF and UNESCO for both initiatives. The initiative is driven by significant international changes in principles and standards, technological developments such as generative AI, and the alignment of the current Artificial Intelligence Strategy for Digital Government, effective since 2020, among other factors. In this consultation and participation process, efforts focused on aspects of institutionalization and governance of the new AI strategy, allowing room to define the alternative that best suits the country (AGESIC, 2023d). The Uruguayan State’s prior experience with AGESIC shows the possibilities within the existing framework to innovate and make institutional adjustments in line with ethical recommendations (AGESIC, 2020a). Furthermore, an article has been included in the Accountability Bill (Ley de Rendición de Cuentas, October 2023) (Law 20.212, 2023) that has assigned to AGESIC the responsibility for designing and developing AI and Data Strategies, while also advocating for the corresponding regulation.
