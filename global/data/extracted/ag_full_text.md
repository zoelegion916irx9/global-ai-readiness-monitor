Foreword
We have officially entered the Age of Artificial Intelligence. The world is now set to change at a pace not seen in decades, even centuries. 
AI-based tools and applications make our lives easier, smoother, and richer. They help us move efficiently, get informed, get credit, 
get a job, and get our taxes done.
But in its current form, AI reproduces and amplifies many of the social challenges we face. It is not acceptable that around a third of 
the world’s population still lacks adequate internet access. Upstream, the AI industry is highly concentrated, with just two countries 
– the United States and China – and a dozen companies accounting for a major share of the sector. This can lead only to greater 
inequality of outcomes – including gender disparities – downstream. Non-diverse AI teams, unrepresentative datasets, and opaque 
and biased algorithms can cause harm, particularly to those who are already vulnerable, whether companies or individuals, children 
and young people, women, or entire democracies.
That is why UNESCO drafted the Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, which was adopted in 2021 by 193 
countries to make sure AI delivers fair, sustainable, and inclusive outcomes. The Recommendation is based on the protection and 
promotion of human rights, human dignity, and environmental sustainability, and these values are then translated into principles 
such as accountability, transparency, and privacy. The Recommendation also sets out concrete policy actions that governments can 
draw on to steer technological developments in a responsible direction, premised on the belief that light-touch regulation, which 
has until now remained the norm, is insufficient. We need capable governments that are well equipped, in terms of competencies, 
institutions and laws, to frame responsible AI development and protect the rule of law online, and public and private developers 
who are accountable for putting human rights and fundamental freedoms – not profits or geopolitical considerations – first.
The Readiness Assessment Methodology (RAM) is a diagnostic tool intended to assist Member States in upholding their commitment 
to the Recommendation by helping them understand how prepared they are to implement AI ethically and responsibly for all their 
citizens. By highlighting any institutional, regulatory, or data gaps and obstacles, it enables UNESCO to tailor support for governments 
to fill those gaps to ensure an ethical AI ecosystem aligned with the Recommendation.
In 2024, the government of Antigua and Barbuda, with support from the UNESCO Office for the Caribbean, implemented the RAM 
through a comprehensive questionnaire involving stakeholders from the public and private sectors, civil society, and academia. 
The initiative engaged over 100 participants from across the country, representing various groups, government units, private entities, 
and academic institutions.
The findings of the assessment were derived from qualitative data collected during stakeholder consultations and quantitative data 
sourced from reports, documents, and the nation’s legal framework.
This report highlighted several strengths in Antigua and Barbuda›s infrastructure and regulatory framework that support the ethical 
development and utilization of AI for the benefit of all citizens. Among the key strengths is Antigua and Barbuda’s strong emphasis 
on accountability, demonstrated by ranking 20th globally in the Right to Information (RTI) index. Similarly, the government aims to 
fully digitise public services by 2030.
Nevertheless, significant challenges persist, including the lack of a national AI strategy, outdated data protection legislation, 
and insufficient digital skills capacity within the public sector. Antigua and Barbuda›s low ranking on the ITU Global Cybersecurity 
Index further emphasises the critical need for improved legal and technical frameworks.
The report presents several policy recommendations to tackle these challenges, including the formulation of a National AI Strategy 
emphasizing ethical AI governance and targeting areas for accelerated development. It encourages Antigua and Barbuda to establish 
a dedicated AI unit to manage AI policies and implementation. Additionally, the country is advised to leverage regional collaboration 
and resource sharing within CARICOM and the OECS to align AI initiatives across the region. Crucially, investments in capacity-building 
are necessary to develop a skilled AI workforce, ensuring sustainable integration of AI technologies.

### Page 10

These recommendations offer a strategic roadmap for Antigua and Barbuda to leverage AI as a transformative driver of 
national development.
Overall, this report presents a fundamentally optimistic vision that we at UNESCO share: that ethical governance and responsible 
regulation of AI is entirely consistent with innovation and economic growth and is essential for ensuring a technological ecosystem 
that benefits the public good. With the RAM data and this report, Antigua and Barbuda has a clear roadmap for how to get there.
It was a pleasure working with the Government of Antigua and Barbuda to conduct this exercise. We are grateful for their engagement 
with the RAM and I am sure that by following the path laid out in this report, Antigua and Barbuda will be able to reap the benefits 
of AI while making sure that AI technologies deliver fair, sustainable, and inclusive outcomes.

Executive Summary
UNESCO’s Recommendation on the Ethics of AI which was adopted by all 193 member states serves as the benchmark 
for the ethical development, use and deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI). 
UNESCO Office for the Caribbean plays a key role in implementing the Recommendation by assisting governments in developing 
AI strategies and policies. Through the Readiness Assessment Methodology (RAM), a comprehensive framework for evaluating 
a country’s readiness to implement AI ethically and responsibly for all its citizens, UNESCO assists countries in evaluating critical 
infrastructure, including institutions, government frameworks, and private enterprises while considering each country’s unique 
values, cultures, and challenges.   
The implementation of the RAM in Antigua and Barbuda is pivotal in guiding UNESCO’s efforts to support tailored policy reforms 
that address the country’s unique needs. By assessing existing frameworks, including laws, policies, and institutional structures, 
the RAM provides insights to strengthen human capacity, enhance accessibility, and ensure that regulations are robust enough 
to tackle challenges related to AI. 
The RAM implementation in Antigua and Barbuda involved gathering and analysing qualitative and quantitative data to:
1.	 Understand how well-prepared Antigua and Barbuda is to adopt, utilise, and develop AI in an ethical and responsible manner 
by evaluating the resilience of its legal, educational, scientific, economic, and technical infrastructure. 
2.	 Carefully identify the factors that will support the sustainable adoption and responsible use of AI.
3.	 Brainstorm critical areas to maximise benefits within Antigua and Barbuda’s specific context.
4.	 Formulate actionable recommendations for effective and responsible implementation of AI for the benefit of all citizens 
and residents of Antigua and Barbuda.
The quantitative component involved compiling data from various sources, including government documents, newspapers, 
scholarly publications, reports and indices from international and regional organizations. This was complemented by a qualitative 
study featuring multi-stakeholder consultations with a representative sample from diverse groups.
These engagements encompassed consultation sessions for each dimension of the RAM, which included legal, social and cultural, 
economic, scientific and educational, and technical and infrastructural. Interviews and targeted discussions were also conducted 
with representatives from government entities, private sector organizations, civil society, academic institutions, and youth groups.
Stakeholder consultations also explored opportunities for leveraging AI for social good. Key thematic areas were identified based 
on discussions about addressing critical national challenges through AI. These priority areas include:
1.	 Climate resilience, justice and attribution
2.	 Health and wellness
3.	 Crime and justice
4.	 Tourism sustainability and blue economy
5.	 Government efficiency and economic diversification
Stakeholders identified these as key areas where AI could be prioritised at the national level, ensuring a focused AI agenda that 
aligns with local interests and supports Antigua and Barbuda’s national development goals.

### Page 12

11
Concerning the country’s AI readiness and its ability to adapt, the RAM findings highlighted the absence of a national AI strategy 
in Antigua and Barbuda, alongside challenges such as limited skilled human capital, and a decline in global rankings, including 
the cybersecurity index. 
While the nation benefits from a strong human rights record and a legal system that upholds the rule of law, gaps in AI governance 
remain evident. However, the government has indicated its potential approach to AI policy and regulation by appointing an official 
as the AI policy focal point and expressing plans to review the European Union (EU) AI regulatory framework. Existing legislation, 
such as the Data Protection Act (2013), Electronic Crimes Act of 2013, and Freedom of Information Act, 2004, offers a foundational 
basis for addressing emerging technological challenges. However, these regulations require amendment to remain effective in 
the evolving AI landscape. The RAM highlighted critical gaps in access to high-quality training for the general public, policymakers, 
and AI regulators.  
For the social and cultural aspect, AI systems risk reinforcing gender stereotypes, necessitating efforts to ensure inclusiveness in the 
AI ecosystem. While internet gender parity is near achievement in the Caribbean, disparities persist in meaningful access, digital 
literacy, and STEM representation, with cultural biases discouraging women from pursuing STEM careers. Consequently, investments 
are necessary to promote inclusivity in STEM and AI education while addressing societal barriers that perpetuate these disparities. 
Additionally, Antigua and Barbuda recognises AI’s potential in preserving culture and traditions and enhancing citizen engagement, 
but policy updates are needed to address intellectual property and ethical concerns.
Antigua and Barbuda faces challenges in research funding and limited AI research output. Despite efforts like hosting AI conferences 
and offering Data Science curricula at the University of the West Indies, there is a significant gap in AI-related curriculum at primary 
and secondary school. There is a need to foster research collaboration, enhancing STEM and AI education and strengthening data 
collection on educational outcomes.
For the economic aspects, Antigua and Barbuda lacks a national strategy to address AI’s impact on the labour market. Antigua and 
Barbuda should, therefore, improve data collection and analysis, support and incentivise local AI development, build workforce 
skills, and develop support mechanisms for displaced workers due to AI advancements.
Data capacity and government technological services remain limited, but recent digital development initiatives aimed at a 2030 
target present an opportunity to align with AI adoption. Additionally, there is growing interest from the private sector, with some 
businesses already leveraging AI for routine tasks. 
With widespread internet access and electrification, the technical and infrastructure dimensions in Antigua and Barbuda are well-
suited to enable AI adoption. However, affordability remains a challenge that must be addressed to ensure equitable access to 
AI-driven technologies.
The primary policy recommendations are structured around four strategic pillars: AI strategy, regulation, capacity building, 
and institutional framework.
1.	 AI Strategy
Antigua and Barbuda should develop a national AI strategy that prioritises key «quick wins» by identifying and targeting areas with 
significant potential for economic growth.
2.	 AI Regulation
It is recommended that the country establish AI regulation that define a governance framework aligned with national development 
goals outlined in the AI strategy. This regulation should build upon existing policies to address AI-related challenges, including 
data protection and privacy.
3.	 Capacity Building
Strengthening AI capacity is crucial for sustainable development. Efforts should focus on equipping policymakers and the general 
public with AI-related knowledge while cultivating a highly skilled workforce to support responsible AI adoption and innovation.
4.	 Institutional Framework
Antigua and Barbuda should establish a dedicated AI unit within the government. This unit should take a proactive, action-oriented 
approach with well-defined objectives, deliverables, and timelines, rather than serving solely as an advisory body.

### Page 13

12
The ethical AI adoption and development process in Antigua and Barbuda is likely to face significant risks, including:
1.	 Hesitance from stakeholders to discuss current challenges or participate in AI development dialogues. This is also coupled 
by resistance from key sectors in being part of the AI ecosystem due to corporate secrecy.
2.	 Scarce resources, as Antigua and Barbuda faces pressing developmental challenges, may result in AI adoption and 
development not receiving the necessary focus and priority.
3.	 The institutional framework is not robust, and professional communities remain underdeveloped. Moreover, AI regulation 
needs institutional oversight to ensure that its evolution benefits all citizens. 
4.	 Political or societal resistance may arise due to potential job losses in industries reliant on routine tasks, highlighting the 
need for retraining and upskilling programmes.
5.	 Risks of exacerbating income inequality if AI-driven productivity disproportionately benefits high-skilled workers and higher-
income businesses and individuals.
6.	 Limited broadband affordability to support access for all its citizens. 
Given these challenges, Antigua and Barbuda may struggle to adopt AI technologies swiftly, ethically, and equitably for sustainable 
development. A regional approach that fosters collaboration and resource-sharing would be more effective in accelerating ethical AI 
development for all citizens. Regional and international organizations, such as UNESCO, play a crucial role in advancing AI initiatives 
in Antigua and Barbuda and the wider Caribbean.

### Page 14

DIAGNOSIS OF THE 
NATIONAL AI LANDSCAPE
Despite the absence of a national AI policy in Antigua and Barbuda, the country’s representatives have been role models 
internationally in advocating for responsible AI use. For instance, in a national statement at the 77th United Nations General Assembly 
First Committee, Antigua and Barbuda highlighted the ethical and legal concerns surrounding autonomous weapon systems 
and advocated for responsible AI use that emphasises human dignity and proportionality to prevent harm to human rights and 
freedoms (Government of Antigua and Barbuda, 2022). Furthermore, Antigua and Barbuda is among the 11 countries leading the 
Commonwealth Artificial Intelligence Consortium, an initiative under the Commonwealth Secretariat’s Strategic Plan 2021-2025, 
to harness AI for sustainable development.
Antigua and Barbuda is at a pivotal stage in its journey toward AI development and governance. There is growing enthusiasm 
and an emerging AI ethos in the country, reflected in government initiatives and support from the University of the West Indies, 
Five Islands Campus. Initiatives like the SIDS Conference and the Centre for Excellence on data further highlight the government’s 
vision to address data scarcity and prepare for an AI-driven future, while acknowledging the unique challenges faced by Small Island 
Developing States (SIDS). 
Collaboration with regional initiatives led by organizations such as the Commonwealth Secretariat, ITU, UNESCO, and OECS presents 
an opportunity to create a unified AI framework for the Caribbean. By pooling resources and expertise, this approach could offer a 
more efficient alternative to isolated national efforts. A recent UNESCO survey (2024) on AI, digital transformation, and open data 
among SIDS emphasises the importance of collective action. However, diverse priorities and varying stages of AI development across 
the subregion pose challenges to achieving a cohesive strategy. Despite these obstacles, regional partnerships through bodies like 
OECS and CARICOM have the potential to significantly advance AI development in a resource-efficient manner.
Considering this interest the government of Antigua and Barbuda, through the Ministry of Legal Affairs, Public Safety, Immigration, 
and Labour, has appointed a dedicated official within the ministry to act as the AI policy focal point. Meanwhile, the Ministry of ICTs, 
Utilities, and Energy is responsible for managing eGovernment services and driving the digitization of public services, aiming to 
achieve full digitization by 2030. These ministries play a key role in advancing AI development in the country.
In the subsequent sections, the current AI landscape in Antigua and Barbuda across the five dimensions articulated by the RAM 
will be discussed.

govern its lifecycle. The Readiness Assessment Methodology (RAM) emphasises evaluating existing regulations related to AI within 
its legal dimension. These should include tools to evaluate AI’s impact on high-risk areas, ensure accountability and responsibility, 
provide avenues for remedy and redress, and maintain human oversight throughout. Governments can achieve this by prioritizing 
the use of AI for social good, upholding the rule of law, promoting transparency in democratic processes, and leveraging legislative 
powers to guarantee AI safety for all citizens. Currently, Antigua and Barbuda lacks formal AI regulations, while the government has 
started taking initial steps, setting the stage for AI governance in the future. The country’s constitution and legal framework are 
strongly committed to human rights. This commitment has been recognised by the United Nations Human Rights Index, which 
praised Antigua and Barbuda’s advancements during its 2016 and 2021 periodic reviews, despite resource constraints. While specific 
data on Antigua and Barbuda is unavailable in independent indexes like the «Our World in Data» Civil Liberties Index and the Cato 
Institute Human Freedom Index, Caribbean nations generally rank higher than most countries (Vásquez et al, 2024). 
The following sections will explore the specific aspects of the country’s AI legal and regulatory landscape.
AI POLICY AND REGULATION
The UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of AI encourages Member States to develop national AI policies that define ethical AI 
priorities and outline the roles and responsibilities of key stakeholders, particularly within government, to promote ethical practices.  1
Antigua and Barbuda presently lacks a dedicated national AI strategy, policy, or governance framework for regulating AI.  However, 
the government has begun to signal what approach it might take regarding AI legislation, noting possible plans to review the 
European Union (EU) AI regulatory framework to inform AI regulation in Antigua and Barbuda (Antigua Observer, 2024). As previously 
noted, the country, through the Ministry of Justice and Legal Affairs, has appointed an official to oversee AI policy and regulation. 
This role is crucial, as this official represents Antigua and Barbuda’s interests and advocates for the country’s concerns on the global 
stage. As a result, AI guidelines, governance frameworks, and initiatives developed by international agencies, including those under 
the United Nations, ensure that Antigua and Barbuda is actively included in discussions on AI governance. Moreover, the insights 
gained from these global engagements are brought back home to inform government processes, policies, and actions, fostering 
an AI governance approach that is both collective and globally informed.
While concrete steps and the timeline to draft an AI policy are still in progress, existing laws and regulations in Antigua and Barbuda, 
such as the Data Protection Act (2013) and the Electronic Crimes Act (2013), could be adapted to address aspects of AI governance. 
Moreover, there is a need to assess and update these laws to remain effective in today’s rapidly evolving technological landscape. 
DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY LAWS
The 2024 ITU Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) report places Antigua and Barbuda in the lowest tier (Tier 5) globally, ranking it 
among the bottom 14 nations, and last among the assessed countries in the Americas. This marks a decline from its 2021 standing, 
ranking 142nd out of 182 countries and 23rd among 35 countries in the Americas.

The report highlighted that while the country’s legal measures show some promise, its technical, organizational, and capacity-building 
aspects are weak. Figure 1 presents the 2024 ITU Cybersecurity Index country profile for Antigua and Barbuda.
Figure 1. 2024 ITU Cybersecurity Index - Profile of Antigua and Barbuda.
Antigua and Barbuda’s Data Protection Act, enacted in 2013, provides a framework for data protection and grants individuals control 
over their personal data. 
The Act, through its “Retention Principle”, mandates that personal data should not be retained longer than necessary and requires data 
users to ensure that unnecessary data is either destroyed or permanently deleted. These provisions aim to uphold privacy and data 
security but may need updates to align with the complex challenges introduced by modern AI technologies. Also, this law includes 
transparency and accountability requirements in processing personal data. 
The act also includes a “Notice and Choice” principle which requires data users to inform the data subject about the purposes of data 
collection, the sources of data, the data subject’s rights, and any third parties to whom the data may be disclosed. While no specific 
data minimization is covered, the act states that personal data should be “adequate but not excessive” in relation to the purpose for 
which it is processed.
In general, services are outsourced, and data collection is determined by the requirements of externally acquired software, often 
including data that may not be necessary for a particular instance. Mechanisms for transparency and data minimization are not 
systematically implemented. Because of this, implementing data minimization and clear transparency standards could enhance 
privacy and trust.
Importantly, the law includes specific rules for sensitive information, outlining the conditions under which sensitive personal data may 
be processed, including explicit consent from the data subject, the necessity for legal purposes, medical purposes, or in connection 
with employment, among other conditions. 
The Act, enforces penalties and compensation for data infractions, ensuring redress options for data subjects. Courts may grant 
compensation for harm caused by improper data handling, either alongside or independent of other legal actions.
The principles, rights and obligations found in the Data Protection Act, 2013 of Antigua and Barbuda, applies to both public and 
private bodies. The act distinguishes between public and private entities in its definitions.  These distinctions explain the extent of 
entities covered, but they do not enforce different standards. Additionally, it is primarily concerned with the protection of personal 
data processed by public and private entities, the act does include provisions that protect confidentiality and respect for private and 
family life. 
There is uncertainty around whether the Data Protection Act requires transparency from data users regarding data collection and 
usage. Participants in the RAM consultations emphasised the importance of informing users about how their data is used, highlighting 
the need for public education on data protection rights and responsible data sharing. They noted that greater awareness will help 
foster a culture of data privacy, especially among young people. The need for public consultations and education on data protection 
laws in the context of AI is highlighted as critical both for AI adoption and use and for promoting safe practices when using personal 
data involving AI and algorithmic decision making.

DATA SHARING AND ACCESSIBILITY 
The Open Data Inventory (ODIN) assesses the completeness of a country’s statistical data and its alignment with international 
openness standards. In 2022, Antigua and Barbuda ranked 173rd globally, with an overall score of 30 out of 100. Within the Caribbean 
region, the country placed 7th out of 12 countries. This reflects a decline from 2020, when it ranked 153rd globally.
The RAM stakeholder consultations further revealed that Antigua and Barbuda lacks a data-sharing strategy, has not adopted the 
Open Data Charter, and is not member of the Open Government Partnership. 
Moreover, Antigua and Barbuda was not included in other data related studies such as the Global Data Barometer that evaluates 
how effectively countries manage data for public good. Efforts are underway in the country to formalise data sharing among closely 
connected entities, such as the Inland Revenue Department, Antigua and Barbuda Social Security Board, and the Medical Benefits 
Scheme. Through a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), the One-Stop-Shop initiative seeks to establish a data-sharing framework 
among these key government agencies that frequently interact and either currently share or should be sharing data.
There is a need for establishing mechanisms for data collection and for processing, sharing, and reporting. Concerns have been 
raised about data duplication and the limited ability to process data, even at a basic level.
PROCUREMENT LAWS AND POLICIES 
Antigua and Barbuda’s Procurement Act establishes a procurement board to oversee public procurement processes. However, 
the Act does not include provisions specifically addressing the procurement of AI systems. This lack of specificity presents several 
gaps in the procurement framework which would be necessary for AI systems:
1.	 There are no established standards or certification processes for AI vendors to ensure their compliance with ethical guidelines 
or technical requirements.
2.	 The country does not maintain a formal list of approved AI vendors, making it challenging to track providers who meet 
minimum standards for security, transparency, and performance.
3.	 The procurement process lacks tailored approval mechanisms to evaluate the unique risks and implications of acquiring AI 
technologies, such as bias mitigation, algorithm transparency, and ethical considerations.
4.	 Some entities follow procurement practices tailored to specific needs. For example, certain organizations prioritise data 
sovereignty in their procurement processes. However, these practices are not standardised or widely implemented.
Establishing a structured procurement policy that integrates principles of AI ethics, accountability, and transparency can build 
public trust while enhancing the efficiency and fairness of AI system implementation. This is a critical step for Antigua and Barbuda 
to ensure the successful and responsible deployment of AI systems.
FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACTS/ ACCESS TO KNOWLEDGE ACTS
Antigua and Barbuda holds an impressive 20th place out of 140 countries in the Global Right to Information (RTI) ranking. Antigua and 
Barbuda outperformed many global leaders in AI and technology, as major AI-driven nations such as the Netherlands, the United 
States of America, and the United Kingdom are ranked at 77th, 78th, and 43rd respectively. The country’s high RTI ranking suggests 
that it has effectively prioritised openness and accountability even without much of the technological innovations of the other 
larger countries. This practice could possibly be extended to technologies like AI. This emphasis on transparency could be a key 
asset for Antigua and Barbuda in developing and implementing ethical AI frameworks, as citizens’ trust in the government’s ability 
to regulate and use AI responsibly is crucial.
Under the Freedom of Information Act, 2004 of Antigua and Barbuda, individuals have the right to request information from public 
officials, this law however does not explicitly cover information about how AI systems are utilised in the public sector.

### Page 18

DUE PROCESS AND ACCOUNTABILITY
In Antigua and Barbuda, the Constitution is the supreme law protecting individual rights and due process. Key protections include: 
	•
Chapter II: Guarantees life, liberty, security, and legal protection. 
	•
Article 15: Protects personal liberty, prohibiting arbitrary detention. 
	•
Article 16: Prohibits torture and inhumane treatment. 
	•
Article 18: Ensures the right to a fair hearing and presumption of innocence. 
	•
Article 21: Grants freedom of movement. 
The Constitution also safeguards freedom of expression, protection from discrimination, and property rights, contributing to the 
concept of “due rights.” However, there are no frameworks or laws which require that individuals must be informed that they are 
interacting with AI systems. Antigua and Barbuda does not have specific legislation or policy that directly addresses the monitoring, 
redress, and remedial mechanisms for harm caused by AI systems. However, the country’s existing legal framework provides 
mechanisms that could be applied to AI-related harm, particularly through consumer protection, data protection, privacy laws, 
and constitutional rights. Due to the specifics of AI, there are grey areas and therefore these laws with indirect application need to 
be updated to cover AI specifics.
Without an AI regulator, it is not directly clear as to whether the court can request information about AI systems and their inner 
workings under the law. However, under the different acts, there is possibility through Judicial Review: Courts may seek information 
about AI systems in cases of discrimination or unfair treatment, often through expert testimony or audits. 
Antigua and Barbuda does not have a specific liability regime for harms caused by AI systems. However, existing general laws may 
be extended or implicitly applied to address such harms, for example:
	•
Tort Law: Claims for negligence or product liability can be made if an AI system causes physical, financial, or reputational harm. 
	•
Contract Law: Liability can arise if AI fails to meet contractual expectations or causes a breach. 
	•
Consumer Protection and safety Act: Provides remedies if AI-based products or services harm consumers and regulators may 
investigate and request information if it harms consumers.
	•
Employment Law: Addresses discriminatory practices by AI in hiring or performance evaluations. It might be possible for 
courts or regulators to request AI-related information if there are claims of discriminatory practices.
ONLINE SAFETY AND INTEGRITY OF SPEECH
There is no clear indication of a framework for notice and takedown policies for content violations in the various legislation. However, 
the Electronic Crimes Act, 2013 of Antigua and Barbuda, does address some of these infringements. Part two of the act, Sections 4, 
13, and 14 on “Offenses,” criminalises harassment and sending offensive, threatening, or misleading information through electronic 
systems, along with prohibiting setting up fake websites or sending misleading electronic messages. These clauses criminalise certain 
types of harmful or fraudulent content, but they do not issue a formal notice and takedown procedure for removing content from 
online platforms. 
The opportunity exists to develop a law or policy focusing on the impact of the use of AI on social media, including issues such as 
transparency, misinformation, disinformation and hate speech.

PUBLIC SECTOR CAPACITY 
2	
Caribbean Telecommunications Union. Partners to Connect for ICT-Enables Development in the Caribbean. Available at: https://ctu.int/ctu-
partners-to-connect-for-ict-enabled-development-in-the-caribbean/
According to the World Bank’s GovTech Maturity Index 2022 report, Globally, “One hundred and five economies (53 percent) declared 
having a coordinating body such as a steering committee or a council leading GovTech initiatives. Considering the importance of 
crosscutting government coordination, the 2022 GTMI results show that despite more than half of the GovTech countries committed 
to this objective, it remains an important building block that is missing in the remaining 93 economies.”
Antigua and Barbuda does not have a comprehensive government policy to support GovTech startups, an innovation strategy, 
or structured programmes to develop digital skills across the public sector.
There is no formal platform for collecting citizen feedback on government policies, nor is there a statistical system in place to measure 
engagement levels. This limits the government’s ability to understand public sentiment and incorporate community input effectively. 
The country does not currently have a centralised government job portal, which could streamline recruitment processes and make 
public sector opportunities more accessible to citizens. Antigua and Barbuda has implemented online services in areas such as 
insurance/pensions and customs through a single-window platform, allowing for greater efficiency and convenience for citizens.
There is a shared consensus on the urgent need for digital skills development programmes tailored to public servants. The introduction 
of new digital products and services in the public sector requires a concerted effort to train staff. Public servants need continuous 
learning opportunities to stay current with the latest technologies and digital tools that enhance service delivery and internal 
processes. Antigua and Barbuda aims to complete the digitalization of the public sector by 2030 according to the UNDP guided digital 
assessment done in 2023 (Carruthers, 2024).  Moreover, the Caribbean Telecommunication Union (CTU) has pledged to support the 
development of the digital economy among its member states in collaboration with the ITU. Its 2020–2024 agenda emphasises the 
importance of public awareness and digital growth, reaffirming its commitment to these initiatives.2
Presently, there is no direct indication that there are any mandatory digital skills programmes for public sector employees. 
Recommendations – Legal Dimension
1.	 Develop an AI-specific regulatory framework that prioritises Impact Assessments for high-risk AI applications, evaluating 
their societal, economic, and legal implications. Develop soft-laws governing the procurement of AI systems.
2.	 High-level decision-makers require training in AI ethics and regulation to ensure that the benefits and risks of AI are thoroughly 
and thoughtfully evaluated at the highest levels of government and civil society.
3.	 Public awareness about AI and fostering an AI ecosystem is essential for sustainable development. 
4.	 AI regulations should be designed to align with the ongoing digital transformation agenda to ensure coherence between 
AI policies and efforts to digitise government services. 
5.	 A collaborative effort to a legal framework with regional bodies like CARICOM and OECS is recommended. 
6.	 Incentivise ethical AI development in Antigua and Barbuda especially since currently, the government, private sector, civil 
society, and citizens primarily consume AI, rather than produce it. 
7.	 Formulation of a government unit to guide AI policy development, AI regulation, support AI development and provide 
institutional oversight over the ethical and responsible AI use, development and deployment in the country.

SOCIAL AND CULTURAL 
DIMENSION 
UNESCO, in 2019 reported that AI systems may reinforce harmful gender norms and stereotypes, such as endorsing the subjugation 
of women in positions of servitude. The social and cultural dimension focus on factors ensuring inclusiveness and social and cultural 
diversity, public awareness and values related to the scaling up of ethical AI solutions. Ensuring that AI systems do not contribute 
to the amplification of structural bias. This section therefore focuses on issues of gender inequality and the bias that may arise from 
a lack of representativity in datasets and embedded biases in algorithmic systems, due to a lack of diversity and gender equality in 
the teams designing and producing AI systems.
DIVERSITY, INCLUSION AND EQUALITY
According to recent data from the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), in regions with higher internet usage, such as the 
Americas, gender parity in internet access has been achieved or is near achievement. This is evident in many Caribbean nations, 
including Antigua and Barbuda, where the overall internet usage rate is relatively high, and the gender parity score is close to 1.0, 
signalling near equality in access between men and women (ITU, 2023).
SIDS, including Antigua and Barbuda, are unique in that they tend to have a higher gender parity score compared to other low-
income or less developed regions. While global averages show men using the internet more than women (70% men vs. 65% women), 
small island nations have a parity score close to 0.97, and in some cases, women even outnumber men in internet usage (ITU, 2023).
However, it is essential to note that while Antigua and Barbuda and many Caribbean nations show progress, disparities still exist in 
terms of meaningful internet access, including affordability, digital literacy, and the ability to leverage online resources effectively, 
which can also contribute to gender gaps.
In Antigua and Barbuda, as well as across the Caribbean, there are significant gender disparities in STEM (Science, Technology, 
Engineering, and Mathematics) fields at the tertiary education level. Globally, only about 35% of STEM graduates are women, 
with this figure remaining stagnant over the past decade. The situation is similar in Caribbean nations, where the percentage of 
women in STEM programmes is lower compared to men. In some countries, such as Trinidad and Tobago and Barbados, women 
make up only a minority of STEM graduates, despite women being the majority in overall tertiary education enrolment.
The OECD’s Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2018 revealed that 22% of top-performing boys in science and 
mathematics expected to work in STEM-related professions by age 30, compared to only 12% of top-performing girls. This trend 
extends to the Caribbean, where countries like Jamaica, the Bahamas, Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, and St. Lucia face similar 
gender disparities in STEM aspirations. Despite strong academic performance in science and mathematics, many girls do not 
envision a future in STEM careers, often due to societal expectations and gender stereotypes. Stakeholder consultations provided 
qualitative insights into this issue. Female students in STEM disciplines reported feeling isolated in Computing, Engineering, and Data 
Science classes, which are often male-dominated, both in terms of students and instructors. This contrasts with their experiences 
in non-STEM subjects, which tend to have a more balanced gender representation. Participants highlighted cultural factors as a 
root cause, with certain subjects being perceived as «male-oriented» from an early stage of education, while others are labelled as 
«feminine,» further widening the gap in STEM preparedness among college-bound students.
In Antigua and Barbuda, efforts are tied to broader initiatives to promote digital inclusion. For example, policies focused on ICT 
development and expanding broadband access also aim to close the gender divide by ensuring that women and girls have 
equal opportunities to benefit from digital advancements. Similarly, efforts to address digital and socioeconomic disparities, 
including those between rural and urban populations, are underway. The government has introduced national policies aimed at 
improving digital access as part of broader initiatives to build a more resilient economy. These policies align with environmental

### Page 21

20
and socioeconomic strategies, such as the Sustainable Island Resource Framework Fund and the Green Climate Fund, which seek 
to enhance climate resilience and sustainable development through technology and education.
Policies around environmental sustainability have also included initiatives to improve access to information and digital tools, which 
indirectly help close the rural/urban digital divide by encouraging the adoption of renewable energy solutions (e.g., solar and wind 
power) and promoting the use of technology to manage resources more efficiently.
PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT AND TRUST
According to the UN Public Administration Network’s Online Services Index, Antigua and Barbuda has a score of approximately 0.41. 
The index ranges from 0 to 1, with higher scores signifying a greater availability and quality of digital services. This score is below 
the regional and global average. A score of 0.41 suggests Antigua and Barbuda has a moderate level of online services available to 
citizens.  Figure 2 highlights Antigua and Barbuda’s online service index in comparison to other Caribbean countries.
Figure 2. United Nations Public Administration Scores on Online Service Index for the Caribbean Region in 
2024.

### Page 22

21
Moreover, the E-Participation Index measures the extent to which citizens are able to participate in government decision-making 
through online channels. Antigua and Barbuda’s score of 0.3425 is below the global average and the regional average. This suggests 
that Antigua and Barbuda has room for improvement in terms of providing online channels for citizen participation.  
It is important to note that the E-Participation Index is just one measure of e-government development. Other factors, such as the 
availability of online services and the quality of government websites, are also important.
The E-Government Development Index (EGDI) is a composite index that measures a country’s level of e-government development. 
It assesses three key dimensions:   
1.	 Online Services Index: This measures the extent to which public services are available online.   
2.	 Telecommunication Infrastructure Index: This measures the availability and quality of information and communication 
technologies (ICTs).   
3.	 Human Capital Index: This measures the skills and knowledge of the population, particularly in relation to ICTs.   
Antigua and Barbuda’s EGDI score of 0.6113 in 2022 indicates a moderate level of e-government development. While it has made 
progress in recent years, there is still room for improvement, particularly in terms of expanding online services and enhancing digital 
literacy. To further improve its e-government ranking, Antigua and Barbuda may consider the following strategies:
1.	 Expanding online services through offering a wider range of public services online, such as tax filing, passport services, 
and business registration, which are slated to be included in its efforts for a One-Stop-Shop e-service approach.
2.	 Investing in educational and training programmes to equip citizens with the necessary skills to use online services.
3.	 Implementing robust cybersecurity measures to protect government systems and citizen data.
4.	 Strengthening public-private partnerships by collaborating with the private sectors and academic institutions to develop 
innovative e-government solutions.
By implementing these strategies, Antigua and Barbuda can further improve its e-government development and enhance the 
delivery of public services to its citizens.
When participants in the RAM consultations were asked about their trust in Government websites, one participant noted  “I don’t 
think it’s a general trust. It’s just the data. How accurate and up to date is it?”  This suggests that once information is current and 
truthful, it will be considered reliable and worthwhile for use. 
In terms of trust in AI, many participants of the multistakeholder consultations expressed scepticism about AI, particularly among 
older audiences who remain cautious about fully relying on AI systems. In contrast, younger individuals – who also engaged in a 
dedicated youth-focused consultation - are more enthusiastic about AI but raised concerns about over-reliance. This concern may 
also indicate the right mindset that is necessary for responsible use. Public trust in both government websites and AI can be built 
through transparency, regular updates, and clear communication.
ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY POLICIES 
 The Environmental Protection & Management Act of 2019 sets the groundwork for environmental protection in Antigua and Barbuda. 
Although it doesn’t directly mention AI, it could potentially guide the creation and implementation of AI solutions in fields such as 
environmental surveillance, resource administration, and pollution mitigation. Other laws such as the Fisheries Act of 2006, could 
be extended to include AI.
Antigua and Barbuda recognises that AI for sustainability is a priority and can support environmental goals, such as climate resilience 
and early warning systems. However, the sustainability of AI itself, particularly its carbon footprint and energy use, also needs attention. 
Currently, there is no policy to address AI’s environmental impact. Nevertheless, there is recognition that any investment, including 
in AI, must consider ecological and environmental impacts.

HEALTH AND SOCIAL WELLBEING
The World Health Organisation (WHO) defines health as ‘a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely 
the absence of disease or infirmity.’   Well-being can be described as the state of being comfortable, healthy, and prosperous. Health 
and well-being are fundamental values of responsible AI, which should be advanced by ensuring that the quality of life for both 
individuals and communities is protected and enhanced throughout all stages of the AI life cycle. 
Currently, there is no digital health policy, however, Antigua and Barbuda is actively pursuing digital transformation across its health 
sector, aiming to enhance access to healthcare and streamline data management through technology. Plans are being put in place 
to achieve this, with a collaboration with the Pan American Health Organization, in 2024 on emergency preparedness, by utilizing 
digital tools like the Strategic Toolkit for Assessing Risks.
The Country’s National Strategic Plan for Health 2016-2020 report identified the need for robust health information systems to enable 
comprehensive analysis of health data as a major challenge (WHO, 2016).
The Ministry of Health is leading efforts to implement electronic health records, allowing for improved patient care and more efficient 
data handling. Additionally, telemedicine initiatives have been launched, particularly to support residents in remote areas, enhancing 
healthcare accessibility and responsiveness.
CULTURE
There is lack of specific policies in Antigua and Barbuda regarding AI for cultural heritage preservation.
In the formulation of the regulation, there are issues related to intellectual property rights, especially for AI-generated art. Additionally, 
potential ethical dilemmas surrounding AI-generated cultural content and its impact on social engagement further complicate the 
discussion. The intellectual property laws, established in 2003, need to be updated to keep pace with advancements in emerging 
technologies, including Artificial Intelligence. For instance, AI’s role in creative processes and the generation of content raises ethical 
and legal concerns that must be addressed through regulation. Additionally, challenges related to data limitations, copyright, 
and intellectual property rights are significant. Revising the current regulatory framework is essential to account for these complexities, 
especially since access to data is crucial for AI development.
Antiguan and Barbudans recognise AI’s potential to preserve cultural knowledge and practices, such as traditional games like Warri 
and Marbles and herbal remedies. Importantly, the opportunity for customised digital solutions tailored to individual preferences, 
such as AI systems designed to interact in local dialects and incorporate cultural content, was seen as ideal for promoting and 
preserving culture and local traditions. The discussion highlighted the importance of community participation as the foundation of 
digital development, emphasizing the need for greater citizen engagement through technology-driven initiatives. However, for these 
efforts to be effective, they must be supported by affordable internet access and widespread availability of computing devices.
Recommendations – Social & Cultural Dimension
1.	 Tailor educational programmes and curricula around AI to align with subjects that attract and retain female students, while 
ensuring that training programmes also support career opportunities. 
2.	 Allocate resources to utilise AI for the preservation and promotion of cultural heritage, languages, and traditions.
3.	 Encourage a more inclusive approach to AI consultations by involving a diverse range of stakeholders from various sectors, 
not just technical personnel. 
4.	 Develop policies and incentive mechanisms to promote the use of AI for sustainable development while ensuring the 
responsible and sustainable growth of AI within the country.
5.	 Digitalization efforts should prioritise creating public-facing portals to enhance access to e-government services.

SCIENTIFIC AND EDUCATIONAL 
DIMENSION
The rigor of science and the strength of the education system are crucial for delivering high-quality solutions and ensuring 
productivity across various sectors. The scientific and educational aspect of the RAM evaluates the nation’s current capacity in AI 
research alongside the state of AI-related education.
RESEARCH AND INNOVATION 
Globally, as part of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), countries such as those in the Caribbean have pledged to dedicate at 
least 1% of the GDP to Gross Expenditure on Research and Development (GERD) to support research and innovation. According to 
the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS), the GERD in 2020 for Latin America and the Caribbean is at 0.63 to 1.05 for SIDS, while the 
world average is 1.93. Looking at individual countries, there were no statistics for most of the Caribbean countries. Among countries 
with reported data, Trinidad and Tobago had the GERD of 0.06 in 2019, while Cuba recorded the highest at 0.52 in 2020 (Trading 
Economics, n.d.). Further details on the GERD can be seen in Table 1 below.
Antigua and Barbuda does not have a well-established or any reported data on the GERD. Like many data-scarce regions, this data 
is available but not readily harvested. While the  zero-budget allocation is alarming, it highlights the opportunity to better align 
developmental agendas with robust and rigorous scientific research. 
Antigua and Barbuda lacks documented or readily shared data on GERD in natural sciences and engineering as a share of GDP. 
According to data from Trading Economics website, Trinidad and Tobago does not specify gross expenditure on research and 
development on natural sciences and engineering as a share of gross domestic product, but the GERD was reported to be 0.05382% 
of the GDP in 2021; 13.19 USD million.
There are no resident units performing research and development (R&D). While some units or businesses engage in research, they are 
unaware of how to measure the budget allocations. 
According to the 2024 Budget statement, Antigua and Barbuda does not have any publicly released data on Government Budget 
Allocations for Research and Development (GBARD).

RESEARCH OUTPUT 
There is no significant research output in the Antiguan and Barbudan context- there are no citations on AI. There is no data on AI 
research output, nor are there publications at the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Conference on Fairness, Accountability, 
and Transparency (FAccT). In terms of AI research output, OECD data is visualised in the graph in Figure 3. The solid blue line represents 
the number of AI research publications from Antigua and Barbuda. Larger Caribbean countries such as Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica, 
and the Dominican Republic have significantly higher publication numbers, suggesting a more established AI research ecosystem. 
This could be due to larger research institutions, more funding, or a larger pool of AI researchers. Smaller island nations like Grenada, 
Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Antigua and Barbuda have lower publication numbers. 
Despite the current trends, Antigua and Barbuda has the potential to increase its AI research output by: 
	•
Collaborating with other Caribbean nations with stronger AI research programmes and facilitating knowledge sharing and 
joint research projects.
	•
Increasing government support for AI research, including funding and policy initiatives, to stimulate growth. 
	•
Promoting AI education and research at the university level to nurture a new generation of AI researchers. 
	•
Collaborating with local industries to provide real-world problem statements and data for AI research.

Antigua and Barbuda has seen one conference on AI and it included an ethical component. The University of The West Indies, 
Five Islands Campus, held its 1st 5IR AI annual research conference,3 which included a theme on the ethics of AI.
AI research in the region is generally limited, with ethical AI research being a relatively new area of focus. This aligns with findings 
from the UNESCO Science Report (Gajadhar & Kahwa, 2021), which highlighted similar trends. The report indicated that research 
efforts are primarily concentrated on health sciences rather than technology, with technological research remaining underdeveloped 
in the region. This underscores the need to enhance capacity in this domain. Figure 4 is sourced from the UNESCO Science Report 
2021, and it illustrates the areas of research covered.

AI TALENT AND INNOVATION OUTPUT 
The University of the West Indies has about seven faculty members focused on AI research, but specific data on AI researchers, 
independent contributors, Kaggle Grandmasters, AI patents, and GitHub activity in Antigua and Barbuda is not readily available. 
Given the competitiveness of Kaggle and the region’s size, the number of Grandmasters is likely low. Overall, limited data on AI 
talent and innovation in the Caribbean makes it challenging to assess the region’s capabilities accurately. For instance, data on 
GitHub contributions, a popular platform for open-source software development, reveals minimal activity from Caribbean countries, 
including Antigua and Barbuda. This suggests that there may be fewer individuals actively involved in AI research and development 
in the region.

EDUCATION STRATEGY 
While there is currently no formal plan to integrate AI and other digital tools into the education curriculum, the Ministry of Education, 
Sports, and Creative Industries is actively promoting AI-related fields. Efforts such as providing robotics kits and hosting AI-focused 
summer STEM camps are promising steps towards a future where AI is more strategically embedded in the education curriculum.
Antigua and Barbuda does not have any laws or policies on how educators/professors should be trained to teach about AI/technology. 
The government supports capacity building of its workers and teachers by offering scholarships and study leave; however, the field 
of study depends on the recipient. A colleague can choose to upskill in AI-related domains based on available training or based 
off a curriculum of the institutions offering the programme. The government system currently lacks mechanisms for defining AI in 
education or training AI educators.
EDUCATION INFRASTRUCTURE
According to a report by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), internet connectivity in educational institutions has 
reached impressive levels in the country. The ITU revealed that 90% of primary schools now have access to the internet, showcasing 
significant progress in bridging the digital divide for younger learners. Additionally, the report highlighted that at least 95% of lower 
secondary schools are also connected to the internet, indicating a strong commitment to ensuring that older students can leverage 
online resources for their education.
These are commendable progress in connectivity, it was noted that Antigua and Barbuda has the ambition of providing every student 
with a personal laptop. Currently, secondary schools generally have access to computer labs.
CURRICULUM CONTENT
Antigua and Barbuda has a single institution actively focusing on artificial intelligence (AI), offering programmes centred on data 
science. At The University of the West Indies (UWI) Five Islands Campus, a minor in Applied Data Science has been introduced, designed 
to integrate seamlessly with various disciplines. 
In addition to this minor, the campus has launched a programme in Generative Pharmacy, which is deeply rooted in AI principles.
However, there is a notable absence of programmes or modules dedicated to emerging interdisciplinary areas like digital anthropology 
or the philosophy of technology. These fields explore the societal, ethical, and cultural implications of technology, which are 
increasingly relevant in today’s AI-driven world. 
At The University of the West Indies, every data science programme includes a dedicated module on ethics. Similarly, secondary 
school curricula feature courses that cover programming alongside the ethics and integrity of data, information, and digital systems. 
Despite these initiatives, participants in the consultations observed that these programmes often face lower enrolment compared 
to business-related subjects, highlighting a potential need for greater awareness and promotion of technology-focused subjects.
EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT 
The percentage of graduates from ICT programmes, is not well known, and much of the statistical data that has been collected is 
outdated. While collecting such data could be relatively straightforward, there are currently no established mechanisms to track and 
systematically gather this type of information.
Institutions like the newly established University of the West Indies (UWI) Five Islands Campus have data on their cohorts, with a 
total of ten graduates since 2023. However, there appears to be a lack of consistent efforts to monitor the number of Antiguans and 
Barbudans graduating from overseas institutions in ICT-related fields.

This gap in data collection is a significant limitation for strategic planning and policymaking. Accurate data and metrics are essential 
for assessing the state of human resource development and ensuring alignment with national development goals. Without such 
information, it becomes challenging to identify trends, make informed decisions, and allocate resources effectively.
Similarly, the number of advanced degrees holders such as Ph.D. recipients in the country is not known, reflecting another critical gap 
in data collection. Additionally, the absence of postdoctoral opportunities within Antigua and Barbuda further highlights a limitation 
in highly skilled AI specialist and limitations on advanced research and academic development. Establishing mechanisms to collect, 
analyse, and report such data is crucial for building a knowledge-based economy and fostering sustainable growth.

PUBLIC ACCESS TO AI EDUCATION 
Antigua and Barbuda currently does not offer dedicated, publicly accessible technical AI courses offered within the country. While 
platforms like Coursera provide opportunities for individuals to learn and strengthen competence in various fields, there is limited 
data on the participation of Antiguans and Barbudans in these courses. Notably, Antigua and Barbuda is not represented in regional 
rankings for online course participation (See Table 2). 
Across the Caribbean, the emphasis tends to be on business-related fields. For instance, in countries like the Dominican Republic and 
Trinidad and Tobago, a significant portion of the population engages in subjects like project management. However, relatively few 
people focus on data science and technology-related disciplines. Jamaica stands out as an exception, with a noticeable increase in 
interest and participation in data science. This highlights the need for greater promotion and accessibility of technical and AI-related 
education throughout the region, including Antigua and Barbuda.
In Antigua and Barbuda, there are no courses or modules on AI ethics designed for the general population. This gap leaves the broader 
community without accessible opportunities to understand the ethical implications of AI, such as issues surrounding privacy, bias, 
accountability, and the societal impact of AI-driven decisions. Addressing this void could empower citizens to engage more critically 
with AI technologies and foster a more informed public discourse on their ethical use.
Recommendations – Scientific & Education Dimension
1.	 Prioritise the development of a robust research culture by encouraging collaboration across academic institutions, private, 
and public sectors. 
2.	 Increase enrolment in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) and AI-related educational programmes 
creating a critical mass of AI specialists. This involves creating pathways that make these disciplines accessible to 
underrepresented groups, offering scholarships, mentorships, and tailored support to bridge gaps in participation. 
3.	 Launch comprehensive awareness campaigns to demystify AI and engage the public in meaningful discussions about its 
benefits and implications. 
4.	 Cultivate a community of AI experts and professionals encouraging life-long learning and advocacy through professional 
communities like Silicon Dadli.

The economic dimension focuses on the supply side of AI ecosystem. It covers aspects such as the labour market, intermediate 
consumptions etc. These are crucial aspects for evaluating the performance and readiness of the any country’s AI ecosystem.
LABOUR MARKETS
There is no figure that accurately reflects the share of job vacancies requiring AI skills (online) in Antigua and Barbuda. In places like 
Trinidad and Tobago there are over 9,000 remote job vacancies in AI-related skills.4
Similarly to most of the other Caribbean islands there is no publicly confirmed figure about the share of current employees working 
as data scientists in Antigua and Barbuda. However, according to Paylab, the position of a data scientist in the labour market for 
information and technology, is ranked 76th based on salary . 5This implies that there, is for sure, a job market for data scientists in 
Antigua and Barbuda, though there may not be a high demand for them.
There is not enough statistical data within the Caribbean region to rank the countries regarding the relative AI skill penetration. 
According to OECD live data, most studies are focused on the larger Latin American and Caribbean countries like Dominican Republic, 
which is making a lot of efforts into developing their AI industry.
Antigua and Barbuda does not appear in any global or regional rankings for AI talent concentration. The sector remains underdeveloped, 
resulting in limited data and statistics. However, according to the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC, 
2024), a few AI companies have emerged in the Caribbean, particularly in St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, and Barbados.
There is no specific strategy to address AI’s impact on the labour market. Enhancing the frequency and scope of labour market statistics 
collection can better inform AI-related policies and support a more adaptive workforce.

INTERMEDIATE CONSUMPTION 
In 2023, Antigua and Barbuda’s credit data for computer and information services was US$4.790 million, which is an increase from 
2022’s US$4.604 million (IMF, 2023). Details on historical share of the Balance of Payment for Telecommunications, Computer & 
Information is shown in  Figure 5.
Figure 5. Antigua and Barbuda Credit data on Telecommunications, Computer & Information
According to Trading Economics, in June 2024, the value of e-commerce transactions for computers, electronics, and technology 
in Antigua and Barbuda was US $1,470,039.
In the private sector, some experimentation with AI is emerging, but the extent is unclear. There is no direct measurement of AI’s 
contribution to the economy. 
INVESTMENTS AND OUTPUT
The OECD Science, Technology, and R&D Statistics indicate that no Caribbean nation appears in the dataset for Business Enterprise 
R&D Expenditure by industry and type of cost. This suggests that research and development activities among Caribbean companies 
or those operating within the region are minimal.
Similarly, there isn’t much information about the per capita Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code 62.0 for computer 
programming, consultancy, and related activities in Antigua and Barbuda.
According to the World Bank’s development indicators (2023), high-technology exports accounted for 0% of Antigua and Barbuda’s 
manufactured exports. While the gaming sector might contribute to high-tech exports, its exact value is not quoted. Additionally, 
classification challenges complicate accurate reporting, particularly for locally based companies owned by foreign entities, blurring 
the distinction between domestic and international contributions to high-tech exports.

APPLIED STANDARDS
Antigua and Barbuda participates in standardization efforts through the Antigua and Barbuda Bureau of Standards (ABBS), which 
develops standards aligned with the nation’s economic priorities. ABBS is a subscriber member of the International Organization for 
Standardization (ISO), allowing it to receive updates on ISO’s activities. However, this membership does not permit ABBS to actively 
contribute to ISO’s work, sell ISO standards, or formally adopt them at the national level.6
 COMPUTING CAPABILITIES 
Antigua and Barbuda has one data centre operated by Antigua Computer Technology (ACT) (ACT, 2023), but there is no known policy 
for AI-driven cloud computing or any clear plans for its development. The current absence of policy, combined with the country’s 
absence from global and regional AI talent rankings, highlights a significant opportunity to develop structured initiatives to foster 
AI growth and innovation. Meanwhile, other Caribbean nations, such as St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, and Barbados, have begun 
developing AI-driven enterprises.
STATISTICAL PERFORMANCE
The Statistical Performance Indicators (SPI) for Antigua and Barbuda can be evaluated through an assessment of data products, 
data sources, and data infrastructure (Dang et al, 2023).
These indicators demonstrate the country’s ability to collect trustworthy data in varying kinds of categories, including health, 
the environment, and socioeconomic conditions (Jarvis et al., 2023).
According to CEIC (2023), In 2022, Antigua and Barbuda received a SPI overall score of 50.37 on a scale of 0 – 100.
In comparison to worldwide standards, Antigua and Barbuda’s SPI overall score reflects moderate statistical ability. Throughout the 
region, Antigua and Barbuda scores closely to several Caribbean countries and is moderate when compared to better established 
data analysis systems in places like Jamaica or Barbados. On a global scale the country’s performance is slightly lower than the 
average of countries analysed using the same SPI framework.
In 2022, a score of 60.12 on a scale of 0 - 100, was recorded for Antigua and Barbuda’s pillar data products. The score on data 
products in Antigua and Barbuda reflects the availability and quality of statistical outputs that influence policy and decision-making. 
The country has made many strides in health data collection; however, issues still exist in ensuring that data products are continually 
updated and available. 
The high performance of data products suggests that Antigua and Barbuda has a well-established system for producing and 
distributing statistical results such as censuses, surveys, and important economic indicators through Statistics Division, Ministry of 
Finance and Corporate Governance of Antigua and Barbuda.

In the graph in Figure 7, the data source score as represented in aqua, indicates the quality and reliability of the underlying data used 
for statistical analysis. The data infrastructure score, depicted in pink on the graph, reflects the adequacy and efficiency of the systems 
and processes used to collect, store, and manage statistical data. From 2016 to 2018, the score remained relatively low, indicating 
potential weaknesses in the infrastructure. However, a significant improvement was observed in 2021, with the score rising to 40. 
This positive trend continued in 2022 and 2023, reaching 45 in the latter year. This suggests that investments in data infrastructure 
have yielded positive results, leading to enhanced data collection and management capabilities. There are no laws or policies in 
place that offer a comprehensive framework for consistent data management and publication. 
Figure 7. Antigua and Barbuda Score on Data Source
The National Bureau of Statistics Act was recently amended and includes provisions on data management and publication for 
the National Statistics Office (NSO). The Act does not provide a framework covering all entities in the national statistical system. 
Furthermore, quality control processes for government data are not clearly documented across all sectors.
The NSO is mandated to manage data collection and dissemination. The amended Act enhances compliance with international 
best practices, but implementation is still pending. There are opportunities to enhance the collection of statistical data, especially 
in the areas of labour market and AI-related statistics. 
Recommendations – Technical & Infrastructural Dimension
	•
Enhance fixed broadband services and tackle affordability challenges.
	•
Adopt open data policies and create centralised platforms to improve data sharing and accessibility.
	•
Establish policies to ensure data standardization, security, and ease of access.

KEY OBSERVATIONS
The RAM stakeholder consultations, along with quantitative data and literature evidence, have led to several key observations that 
can inform policy recommendations. These observations include:
1.	 No AI policy, regulation or an implementation plan. Implementing an AI policy requires collaboration across multiple sectors. 
To ensure a successful AI strategy, Antigua and Barbuda should encourage cooperation between ministries to establish a 
comprehensive AI framework, promoting a unified and cohesive approach to responsible AI development.
2.	 The potential of AI has not yet been fully realised in tangible terms. Priority areas need to be identified and acted upon to 
capitalise on AI’s potential.
3.	 The private sector is at risk of facing losses due to a lack of widespread acceptance of AI strategies. Companies may end up 
spending more on AI solutions or relying on outdated technologies if AI adoption is not accelerated.
4.	 A clear national development agenda focusing on AI and its integration with other sectors is missing and should be prioritised. 
The national digital agenda should align with the AI strategy. The roll-out of digital and AI solutions must occur in tandem, 
rather than in isolation.
5.	 The significant gender gap in technology-related fields is influenced by cultural norms that categorise certain subjects as 
more suitable for men or women.
6.	 A shortage of highly trained professionals highlights the urgent need to develop a strong AI-ready workforce in both the 
public and private sectors.
7.	 Insufficient funding.
8.	 Limited capacity for statistical analysis and data collection.
9.	 Susceptibility to external disruptions, including those caused by natural disasters.
The research also explores the key areas where Antigua and Barbuda is poised to benefit from AI, addressing sustainability and 
developmental challenges specific to Small Island Developing States (SIDS). These challenges—such as geographical isolation, 
limited resources, and vulnerability to external shocks—can be mitigated through strategic AI use in several sectors.
AI and Climate Resilience, Justice, and Attribution Science
Climate change is a pressing issue for Antigua and Barbuda, as well as other Small Island Developing States (SIDS). Consultations 
highlighted the need to develop AI sustainably, ensuring that investments and applications prioritise environmental responsibility and 
accountability, particularly given the rise in carbon emissions from AI technologies. With a heavy reliance on imported technology, 
there is a growing call for stronger advocacy and procurement regulations to promote sustainability.
Additionally, discussions emphasised the importance of enhancing climate resilience and mitigation strategies through AI-powered 
early warning systems. The role of climate attribution science was also emphasised, with AI being recognised as a tool that can 
support a multi-faceted approach to climate reparative justice. AI has the potential to accelerate these efforts by strengthening 
climate attribution studies, enabling better identification of climate change impacts on vulnerable populations and informing 
effective policy responses.
However, concerns were raised about the transparency and explainability of AI systems, particularly due to the “black-box” nature of 
machine learning models, which could undermine public trust and the reliability of climate studies. Limited access to high-quality 
climate data and technical expertise may also hinder the effective use of AI in climate resilience initiatives. Furthermore, integrating 
AI solutions into existing climate monitoring infrastructure presents logistical and financial challenges that must be addressed to 
ensure successful implementation.

### Page 38

AI and Health and Wellness
AI can play a crucial role in addressing Antigua and Barbuda’s healthcare challenges, particularly the growing burden of non-
communicable diseases (NCDs). It offers the potential for personalised healthcare interventions, enhancing patient outcomes through 
early detection and targeted treatments.
However, significant challenges remain, including the availability and quality of health data in usable formats, concerns over data 
security, and the lack of essential infrastructure needed for effective AI deployment in healthcare.
AI and Crime and Justice
Antigua and Barbuda, like many Caribbean countries, is experiencing a rise in crime. AI has the potential to enhance crime prevention 
and improve systematic policing. Participants highlighted that AI can analyse crime patterns, predict potential hotspots, and support 
law enforcement in making data-driven decisions. They also noted AI’s potential to improve judicial reviews and facilitate timely justice.
However, they also acknowledged concerns about bias in AI algorithms, particularly in predictive policing and crime analysis, which 
could reinforce existing inequalities. Additionally, over-reliance on AI for crime prediction raises risks of privacy violations and potential 
misuse of surveillance technologies.
AI and Tourism Sustainability and Blue Economy
For Antigua and Barbuda, the sunshine and beaches are the “currency” of the tourism blue economy. Stakeholders noted that AI 
can enhance tourism sustainability by managing visitor flows, optimizing marketing strategies, and creating personalised travel 
experiences. It can aid marine conservation efforts by analysing ecosystems, predicting environmental changes, and supporting 
sustainable fishing practices.
AI and Government Efficiency and Economic Diversification
Antigua and Barbuda faces challenges related to limited human and financial resources, making it essential to optimise resource 
allocation and improve efficiency. Participants highlighted AI’s potential to enhance governance by modernizing public services and 
processes. AI can also support data-driven policymaking, leading to better decision-making and efficiency in key sectors.
However, discussions also acknowledged potential resistance to AI adoption due to concerns about job displacement and changes 
in government work structures. Additionally, limited technical expertise and infrastructure within the public sector could hinder the 
effective implementation of AI solutions.
CHALLENGES
The research identified several key challenges that impacted this study and are likely to affect future research and even the deployment 
of AI technology to some extent, representing risks that must be properly managed. These challenges also include some of the major 
issues highlighted by stakeholders, including:
1.	 The state-controlled monopoly on fixed broadband internet services, which the private sector views as a barrier to affordability. 
They argue that increasing the number of service providers would lead to more competitive prices. However, some technology 
partners also contend that the existing ICT companies exceed the local demand and have no need for new entrants.
2.	 Key government stakeholders were unwilling to engage in open discussions about the existing situation as it relates to the 
AI landscape in the country. Some participants were hesitant to share information, mainly due to concerns that it might be 
perceived as criticism of their employers or the government.
3.	 Although government participation was significant, key sectors—such as certain private businesses (law firms, financial 
institutions, gaming companies, chamber of commerce etc.) and civil society groups—were underrepresented. Notably, 
the private sector was underrepresented, despite being a crucial player in AI development. 
These challenges are not unique as a study by UNESCO reported on similar challenges especially on participation and data sovereignty 
related to the data collected (UNESCO, 2024).

Towards a National AI Strategy for 
Antigua and Barbuda
Antigua and Barbuda, like many Small Island Developing States (SIDS), faces the dual challenge of addressing immediate 
developmental priorities—such as climate resilience, economic recovery, and public health—while simultaneously adapting to 
rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI). Balancing these competing demands requires a strategic allocation of resources, 
attention, and priorities to leverage AI’s transformative potential for sustainable development.
The pressing question is how can Antigua and Barbuda effectively allocate the necessary resources and attention to AI regulation 
and advancement while grappling with challenges such as economic pressures and disaster recovery, especially in the wake of 
climate-related crises. Recognizing these realities, the proposed recommendations are organised into four foundational pillars, which 
guide policy formulation and implementation: AI Strategy, AI Regulation, Capacity Building, and Institutional Development.
AI STRATEGY PILLAR
To maximise the benefits of AI, Antigua and Barbuda must craft a clear strategy that identifies high-impact, data-driven opportunities 
that aligns with the nation’s development priorities. The AI strategy must include policies that govern the sustainability of AI and 
mechanisms for responsible and accountable AI ecosystem for all its citizens. The policy should address transparency, accountability, 
and equity, ensuring alignment with global best practices and Antigua and Barbuda’s developmental goals.
This strategy  must:
1.	 Identify Critical Strategic Quick Wins
	•
Pinpoint opportunities where AI can deliver immediate, tangible benefits to foster public and institutional support. 
For example: Use AI to enhance early warning systems for building resilience on the impact of climate-related disasters. 
Employ data-driven decision-making tools to optimise planning and deployment in critical sectors. Utilise AI systems to track 
and improve operational efficiency across government services.
2.	 Develop Roadmaps and Timelines
	•
Develop detailed action plans with clear deliverables, ensuring deliberate and coordinated implementation of AI projects.

AI REGULATION PILLAR
Robust regulation is essential to govern AI development and mitigate risks such as bias, misuse, or ethical violations. This requires 
a balanced approach that fosters innovation while ensuring accountability. To develop this regulation, Antigua and Barbuda can 
focus to:
1.	 Establish policies to safeguard Data Privacy and Security, ensuring the protection of citizens’ information and its ethical 
utilization. 
2.	 Develop interoperability standards to enable seamless integration across sectors, and prioritise transparency to promote 
public engagement, foster trust, and secure full support for AI-driven development.
To achieve these strategic objectives timely, Antigua and Barbuda can:
1.	 Build upon existing data protection and cyber security laws to create AI-specific regulations that address issues such as data 
privacy, algorithmic bias, and accountability. The process should incorporate the country’s specific context and priorities,

CAPACITY BUILDING PILLAR
Investing in human capital is vital to enable AI adoption and innovation. Education and workforce development initiatives should 
focus on building technical and domain-specific AI skills. Importantly, the objective is to create an inclusive critical mass of highly 
trained individuals to propel the ethical and responsible AI developments from policy to the technical dimension of AI. The key 
strategic areas of focus are:
1.	 AI curricula and programmes that specifically appeal to female students by integrating AI with relatable disciplines like 
healthcare, arts, and business.
•	
Highlight successful women in AI and technology through mentorship programmes, conferences, and media campaigns 
to inspire female students.
•	
Support women-centric career pathways, and professional development and reduce barriers to ensure that women remain 
in tech-related fields following their studies.

### Page 41

2.	 Design courses and workshops tailored to policymakers and regulators to help them understand AI’s potential, risks, 
and regulatory implications.
3.	 Introduce AI-focused certification programmes and boot camps for professionals seeking to upskill or transition to AI-
related careers.
4.	 Establish a national database to track the development of AI-related skills in the workforce and measure the impact of 
educational initiatives. 
5.	 Conduct periodic surveys to assess youth interest and participation in AI programmes.
6.	 Develop partnerships with global institutions to provide access to world-class AI education and research facilities.
7.	 Launch AI awareness campaigns targeting the general public, emphasizing the potential benefits and ethical concerns of 
AI technologies.
8.	 Expand programmes in schools and universities to equip students with AI-related skills, including data science, machine 
learning, and ethical AI practices. Develop a curriculum that attracts and retains female students in AI.
9.	  Offer continuous learning opportunities for professionals in government, private sectors, and academia to bridge skill gaps.
10.	 Enhance and support the Summer STEM Camp organised through the Ministry of Education, Sports and Creative Industries. 
There is also a need to introduce more initiatives focused on youth from the early stages of their education to ensure they 
develop and sustain interest in AI subjects. AI-focused workshops and hackathons to inspire and train the next generation 
of innovators. 
11.	 Invest in Research, Development, and Continuous Evaluation (creating an AI ethos through collaboration). Ongoing research 
and evaluation are critical to adapting AI solutions to Antigua and Barbuda’s unique context and ensuring sustainable progress. 
Antigua and Barbuda ought to invest in research to promote the development of mechanisms to regularly evaluate AI projects 
for effectiveness and scalability; use feedback loops to refine and improve AI initiatives; support academic institutions and 
researchers through grants for AI-related studies; host conferences and workshops to share knowledge and promote best 
practices; organise annual conferences to foster dialogue and networking between academia, industry, and policymakers 
on AI innovations and challenges; support and promote open knowledge dissemination to make science accessible. These 
platforms will be primarily for sharing anonymised datasets to support AI innovation and transparency; establish research 
and development centres focused on responsible AI and applications.

INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT PILLAR
 Creating an enabling environment for AI requires institutional investments and fostering collaboration across sectors. In Antigua 
and Barbuda, to sustainably develop, and use AI responsibly the following institutional frameworks should be prioritised.
1.	 Enhance Public Sector Data and Statistical Capacity through the expansion of the Department of Statistics to improve its 
ability to collect, analyse, and publish results in critical areas.

### Page 42

41
•	
Enhance data collection efforts by establishing centralised platforms to facilitate data sharing and analysis, focusing on 
key sectors such as tourism, healthcare, and climate resilience. 
•	
Implement policies to ensure data standardization, security, and accessibility.
2.	 Establish an AI focused agency tasked with regulating, supervising, and promoting AI initiatives. This agency should be granted 
the authority to implement policies, define clear milestones, and engage with international partners to drive AI advancements.
3.	 Drive the growth of AI startups by offering funding and establishing an incubation programme. Support innovation in priority 
sectors by providing tax incentives and creating an environment conducive to entrepreneurial success. Creating an enabling 
environment can be broadly done by improving Antigua and Barbuda’s ease of doing business rankings. According to the 
latest World Bank annual report, the country currently ranks 113th out of 190 economies. With a score of 60.3 out of 100, it also 
holds the 14th position among 32 countries in the Latin America and Caribbean region.
4.	 Building and enhancing the resilience and capacity of civil and social organizations, and professional communities. Currently, 
professional communities like Silicon Dadli remain underdeveloped, and broader civil society lacks the influence needed 
to establish an independent body capable of advocating for, providing training, and promoting engagement initiatives 
effectively. Strengthening these networks is vital for sustainable advancement. Key focus areas include:
	•
Empowering organizations focused on AI ethics and public engagement to foster dialogue and accountability in AI 
development and deployment.
	•
Establishing and advancing professional groups dedicated to supporting professionals in AI, computing, data science, 
and related domains, enhancing skills and collaboration across sectors.
	•
Promoting initiatives that encourage youth participation in the evolution of AI technologies, ensuring their voices shape 
the future of innovation.
	•
Enhancing the capacity of women-in-technology groups to engage, mentor, and recruit new talent, addressing gender 
imbalances and promoting diversity in AI and tech industries.
	•
Strengthening AI-focused student unions and fostering collaborations with academic and professional communities to 
build a pipeline of skilled and engaged talent for the field.

By grounding its efforts in these pillars, Antigua and Barbuda can strategically integrate AI into its development framework, addressing 
immediate needs while positioning itself as a regional leader in AI-driven innovation and sustainability.
Below sections articulate these main policy recommendations and define timelines. The timeline defined is an extensive 4-year plan 
to be implemented between 2025 and 2028.  The recommended timeline is short, but it is recommended that Antigua and Barbuda 
take an agile and lean approach to developing AI policy and an implementation plan to capitalise on the benefits of AI.
The brief overview of this timeline is seen in the below diagram.
Figure 9. Recommended Timeline for Antigua and Barbuda’s RAM Policy Recommendations
It is advised to conduct a thorough evaluation and monitoring process in 2028 to assess the resilience, feasibility, and effectiveness 
of these initiatives, as well as their anticipated outcomes. This review would enable the refinement of a developmental agenda, 
an actionable plan, and systems to monitor progress in key sectors. The reflective approach and continuous evaluation and tracking 
mechanisms are highly recommended to ensure that AI has a significant impact on targeted areas and that resources and investments 
deliver prompt and measurable returns. 
Table 4 summarises the recommendations proposed from the results of the RAM.
