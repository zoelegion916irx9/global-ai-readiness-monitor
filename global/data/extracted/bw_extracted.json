The world is now set\nto change at a pace not seen in decades, even centuries. AI-based tools and\napplications make our lives easier, smoother, and richer. They help us move\nefficiently, get informed, get credit, get a job, and get our taxes done.\nBut in its current form, AI reproduces and amplifies many of the social challenges we face. It is not acceptable that\naround a third of the world’s population still lacks adequate internet access. Upstream, the AI industry is highly\nconcentrated, with just two countries – the United States and China – and a dozen companies accounting for a\nmajor share of the sector. This can lead only to greater inequality of outcomes downstream – including gender\ndisparities.. Non-diverse AI teams, unrepresentative datasets, and opaque and biased algorithms can cause harm,\nparticularly to those who are already vulnerable, whether companies or individuals, children and young people,\nwomen, or entire democracies.\nThat is why UNESCO drafted the Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, which was adopted in\n2021 by 193 countries to make sure AI delivers fair, sustainable, and inclusive outcomes. The recommendation is\nbased on the protection and promotion of human rights, human dignity, and environmental sustainability, and\nthese values are then translated into principles such as accountability, transparency, and privacy. The\nrecommendation also sets out concrete policy actions that governments can draw on to steer technological\ndevelopments in a responsible direction, premised on the belief that light-touch regulation, which has until now\nremained the norm, is insufficient. We need capable governments that are well equipped in terms of\ncompetencies, institutions and laws, to frame responsible AI development and protect the rule of law online. We\nalso need public and private developers who are accountable for putting human rights and fundamental freedoms\n– not profits or geopolitical considerations – first\n03\n\n04\n\nIt is my distinct honour to present the Botswana Artificial Intelligence Readiness\nAssessment Methodology (RAM) Report. This landmark document marks a pivotal\nmoment in our nation’s journey towards harnessing the transformative power of\nartificial intelligence (AI) for sustainable development and inclusive growth.\nAs the world advances rapidly into the digital era, AI stands at the forefront of innovation, offering unprecedented\nopportunities to enhance service delivery, improve efficiency, and unlock new avenues for economic diversification.\nFor Botswana, a country committed to our Vision 2036 and the Sustainable Development Goals, embracing AI is not\nmerely an option, it is an imperative. Botswana is strategically positioned on the global map to host data centres in\nthe southern hemisphere.\nThis assessment provides a comprehensive analysis of Botswana’s current capabilities, strengths, and areas for\nimprovement in AI readiness. It reflects the collaborative efforts of government, academia, industry, and civil society,\nand underscores our collective resolve to position Botswana as a leader in responsible and ethical AI adoption in\nAfrica and the SADC region.\nThe findings and recommendations contained herein will guide our policy formulation, capacity-building efforts\nand investment strategies.
