In collaboration \nwith UNESCO’s Regional Ooffice, this assessment rests at the intersection of technological evolution and ethical imperatives of AI. \nIt emerges as a beacon for Mozambique, not merely as a guide through the intricacies of AI adoption but as a visionary blueprint, \nplacing ethical considerations at its core.\nAccording to the UNESCO recommendations on the Ethics of AI,1 the use of AI systems should not exceed what is required to \nachieve a valid goal. Risks should be assessed to prevent potential hazards from such applications. Unwanted consequences \n(safety risks) and attack vulnerabilities (security risks) should be avoided and addressed by AI stakeholders. Technology must be \ndeveloped in a humanist manner, based on principles and human rights.\nIn Mozambique, as in many developing nations, the journey towards embracing AI unfolds against a backdrop of Internet \nconnectivity ch",
