This aspect has been evidenced in the evaluation phase of the RAM in Ecuador (World Bank Group, 2024). The establishment of a framework for inter-institutional cooperation be- tween the National Institute of Statis- tics and Census (INEC) and MINTEL will facilitate the collection and im- provement of the collection of data and statistics on the use of AI. This, in turn, will strengthen the generation of evidence-based public policies. In addition, inter-institutional coor- dination with key entities such as SENESCYT and the Central Bank of Ecuador is required, to work on the construction and technical valida- tion of indicators related to emerging technologies, such as AI, and their impact on the economic sphere.

At the same time, there is a growing proliferation of continuing education initiatives aimed at a wider audience. Howev- er, most of these programs focus on technical itineraries, which are limited to the use of tools, leaving the impacts and social aspects of technology, and in particular of AI, almost unexplored. It is recommended to incorporate an ethical approach in media and infor- mation literacy (MIL), recognized by UNESCO as a fundamental tool to promote critical thinking, civic partic- ipation and resilience to disinforma- tion. This approach is not only limited to the understanding of traditional media content, but also empowers users to identify the biases inherent in AI systems, understand their basic functioning, and critically evaluate the provenance, intentionality, and consequences of artificially gener- ated texts, images, or audios (UNE- SCO, 2024d).

However, many initia- tives tend to adopt a technologically deterministic perspective, focusing primarily on the tools rather than the socio-ethical implications of their use.

Curricula at all levels should inte- grate interdisciplinary content that fosters digital literacy, ethical aware- ness, and critical thinking.

In terms of information collection, the private sector could invest in track- ing data related to R+D investment, as well as in contracting and imple- menting AI services.

Although this figure offers a starting point, its explanatory capac- ity is limited if it is not complemented by studies that analyse in detail the contents, impacts and applications of these publications. In view of this situation, it is recom- mended that SENESCYT and High- er Education Institutions implement a series of measures to strengthen and make the most of the existing re- search capacities in the country. First, bibliometric studies must be carried out to identify publication patterns, scientific collaboration networks and areas of specialization, facilitating more informed decision-making. In addition, it is suggested to devel- op institutional policies that promote the use of the scientific knowledge generated, promoting its application in local technological developments and solutions to specific problems. It is also imperative to have content on ethics and social studies of science and technology in the training of re- searchers and technicians, covering all educational levels. With these ac- tions, Ecuador can not only increase its scientific production, but also enhance its impact and relevance in society by promoting a cycle of knowledge that responds to local needs and contributes to the sus- tainable development of the country.
