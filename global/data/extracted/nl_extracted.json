It is worthy to note that the exclusion does not apply to dual-use technologies (i.e. those also used outside of the national security context) and that there is no clear definition of national security provided. The exclusions were debated extensively, both during the negotiation phase of the AI Act and by human rights groups.210 The Netherlands’ Stakeholder Team also highlighted caveats and potential weaknesses caused by the exclusions. Stakeholders mentioned the lack of clarity on the scope of national security, the potentially blurry lines between national and public security, and the high-stakes at hand which need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis to meet the requirements of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.211 The stakeholders argued that the Netherlands must clearly delineate how to address the use of AI under the exclusions of the AI Act and take a leadership position on the topic of human rights. Government response The Dutch government acknowledges the exception in the European AI Act for among others national security, military or defence purposes. However, the Dutch government emphasises the need for the responsible and lawful use of AI. 210 Refer to the joint analysis of leading digital, human rights and social justice groups entitled EU’s AI Act fails to set gold standard for human rights (2024).

A central topic of discussion within the GGE LAWS is the application of international law, particularly international humanitarian law. The Netherlands often emphasizes the significance of international human rights law as a relevant legal framework for the potential development, deployment and use of weapon systems with autonomous capabilities and advocates for the inclusion of this topic in international discussions. Notably, the human rights legal framework imposes more stringent requirements on the use of deadly force in law enforcement contexts compared to the provisions of international humanitarian law governing combat operations.

This issue becomes of particular relevance in the case of AI being used for algorithmic-decision making.224 In response, the Stakeholder Team advised to formally integrate civic engagement programs and initiatives in the policy-making process around AI. Government response The Dutch government acknowledges the need to encourage social dialogue and cooperation at various levels in order to be able to respond to the fundamental challenges that AI poses. Ensuring safe and responsible development, use, and integration of AI, as well as maximizing the opportunities that AI offers, requires a coordinated effort from all levels of government, the private sector, technical community, academia and civil society. Together with local governments and implementation organizations, the Netherlands is exploring ways in which AI can support in making communication with citizens clearer and more inclusive. The vision on generative AI has been developed in close collaboration with all levels of government (including organisations responsible for implementing policies), businesses from several domains and sectors, academia and civil society. This cooperation remains essential in the future as well. This means actively involving several actors such as civilians, policy-makers from all levels of government, employers, businesses, entrepreneurs, scientists, employees and educators. It is essential that various actors have a voice in shaping the future where generative AI plays a role.

Academics are well aware of the problematics with the panoply of existing guidelines, and the gap between ethics and practice. In a recent literature study, it was flagged that ethics in the context of AI guidelines is frequently not defined and rather vague, therefore making the application challenging at best, and contested at worst.242 Guidelines often lack agreement, both in terms of what the most important principles are and what their solutions are.243 As a result, one may observe a “gulf between ethical guidelines and practical implementation, a gap between principles and practice” that may maintain the status quo and an undesired outcome “business as usual”.244",

This could lead to new inequalities as municipalities do not benefit from the green energy that is generated there locally.249 In response to these developments and trends, the Stakeholder Team recommended to commit a greater amount of resources into computing power, both in terms of data centres and high-performance computers.

Without targeted policies to improve digital literacy and ensure equitable access to AI technologies, these communities risk being left further behind in a rapidly evolving digital economy. Addressing this gap is essential for ensuring that AI benefits are distributed inclusively, empowering all sectors of society and creating a stronger societal support base for the digital economy. The Netherlands’ Stakeholder Team flagged that digital literacy in the context of marginalized communities remains a policy area for improvement.259 In response, the stakeholders recommended to develop capacities to design policy that addresses digital literacy throughout all layers of society. To do so, civic engagement and the participation of civil society in policy making was proposed as valuable method to follow. 250 Kabinet presenteert visie op generatieve AI | Nieuwsbericht | Rijksoverheid.nl 251 Regeerprogramma (overheid.nl), page 122. 252 Commission launches AI innovation package (europa.eu) 253 EU competitiveness: Looking ahead - European Commission (europa.eu) 254 e6cd4328-673c-4e7a-8683-f63ffb2cf648_en (europa.eu) 255 Motie van het lid Kathmann (16/01/2025). 256 Kamerbrief verkenning mogelijkheden AI-faciliteit | Kamerstuk | Rijksoverheid.nl; Motie van het lid Kathmann (16/01/2025); Motie van het lid Vermeer (16/01/2025). 257 This was particularly recognized in the context of generative AI (Hendawy, 2024). 258 Gonzales, S.

      "text": "Technological developments, such as the development of generative AI, increase the production and dissemination of disinformation. Distinguishing between reliable, objective and factual news and disinformation is becoming increasingly confusing. In addition, AI technology can facilitate microtargeting, posing risks both to privacy and personal autonomy. This necessitates further efforts to increase media literacy among various target groups in order to prevent less digitally adept people from falling behind as well as protecting them from potentially negative effects of AI. In the Netherlands, the Dutch Network on Media Literacy helps foster media literacy among Dutch society, focussing on both resilience against risks and the opportunities AI offers. In the entire educational system, skills such as critical and structured thinking are becoming increasingly necessary. In this context, the reform of the curriculum for primary and secondary education is important. The new core educational objective on digital literacy as recently launched for primary and secondary education, considers four domains: 1) practical ICT skills, 2) media literacy, 3) digital information skills, 4) computational thinking. Students will acquire knowledge about digital technology, learn how to collaborate with them in a critical and (self)conscious manner, and assess the opportunities and risks involved in using them, which is all very relevant for AI. The AI Act lists a number of factors that weigh in when promoting AI literacy, but these need further fleshing out to provide sufficient guidance. In the context, the Dutch privacy authority has published a short guide to promote AI literacy within organizations that develop AI-systems.260 The Dutch government has an active policy to address disinformation and fake news, taking into account new possibilities based on AI.

Standards play an important role in this. Supervisors have a role to support companies, large and small, preventively, and proactively in the practical application of the complex legal rules and thus contribute to limiting the high regulatory burden”.263 It is worthwhile to note that the European Union has taken action on this. Notably, by setting up procurement grants to develop “harmonised frameworks, tools and infrastructure at European level to support compliance with the AI Act that have been tested in practice by under-resourced SMEs and public authorities”.264 The Netherlands can play an important role here and one suggested approach is to assess how rules and regulations interplay",

The Dutch government has called upon the European Commission to strictly enforce the evaluation clauses of the legislation under the digital rulebook.265 Additionally, the Dutch government has spoken out in favour of a review of the entire digital rulebook as a whole when all laws have been implemented. Through such a review, the effectiveness and interplay of the legislation can be mapped and improved. The Dutch government is working on establishing regulatory sandboxes for the AI Act. In 2024, a pilot was conducted to gather information on the practical aspects of operating a sandbox and to receive input from stakeholders. An important aspect of the AI Act sandbox is ‘regulatory learning’. According to this principle, the insights and learned lessons from regulatory sandboxes on the application of the AI Act should be shared broadly within the AI-ecosystem and with policy makers. An important point of attention for the Dutch government in the further implementation is how regulatory sandboxes can contribute to harmonised application of the AI Act.",
