The PBIA also aims to foster and accelerate startups specialized in AI. Among the initiatives, notable ones include the proposal for “periodic calls to develop AI solutions that address public sector challenges and foster govtech startups” and the “creation of an investment fund to support AI startups,” aiming to increase the quantity, revenue, and global presence of Brazilian AI startups (PBIA, 2024). 29 Finally, regarding the amount of private investment in AI in Brazil, official data on statistics such as the market value of shares, venture capital financing, foreign direct investment (FDI) or Business Expenditure on Research and Development is not available.

For this modality, a form was provided with the same guiding questions as for the virtual consultations and 21 additional and optional questions. The collection of information sought to explore specific points related to people´s experience, health, well-being, and familiarity with the opportunities and challenges of AI, such as: i. Have you ever been in an embarrassing situation because of a computer system that you knew was a system error and not a human error (e.g., rejected request, improper login, etc.)? If so, did you receive information or already know how to appeal such a decision? Could you tell us what happened?;; ii. Do you trust your interactions with automated systems and find their results more objective than when you interact with a human?? iii. When it comes to facial recognition, do you feel uncomfortable sharing your facial biometrics? iv. What are the main risks and/or benefits that you can imagine for the use of AI systems in the lives of children and adolescents, including in the school and consumer environments? v. Do you feel that technology has made you happier, more positive, or with less difficult when writing? vi. Do you believe that AI-based technologies, as well as the underlying processes involved in the production and supply chain of these technologies, pose risks to the environment for present and future generations, thereby jeopardizing the UN Sustainable Development Goals? Twenty-two written contributions were received, more than half of which from civil society and the scientific and technological community.

Based on these reflections and suggestions, the recommendations were prepared and submitted to a feedback process from the participants, ensuring greater transparency and accuracy in the application of the Readiness Assessment Methodology. 40 III MAIN POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS This section presents the recommendations resulting from the public consultations and data collection, reviewed based on the comments of the participants who chose to follow the process. Recommendations are organized into three main categories: Regulation, Institutional Framework and Human and Institutional Training. 3.1. REGULATION Recommendation 1. Promoting and implementing the UNESCO Recommendation on AI Ethics. In view of the norms contained in the 1988 Federal Constitution, particularly with regard to the promotion of peace, equality, development, democracy and human rights, in all their forms and for all peoples, whether Brazilian or foreign, it is recommended that the Brazilian government continue its efforts to effectively implement the UNESCO Recommendation, with an emphasis on promoting ethics, transparency and respect for human rights in the development and use of AI. Adopting a clear and robust legal framework for AI regulation will help ensure rights protection, sustainable innovation, and alignment with international best practices. In addition, it is recommended to the National Justice Council to incorporate the UNESCO Recommendation on AI Ethics in the update of Resolution No. 332/2020. Main responsible institutions: All government institutions, especially the MRE, MCTI and CNJ Recommendation 2. Creating and maintaining a national database and statistics on AI.
