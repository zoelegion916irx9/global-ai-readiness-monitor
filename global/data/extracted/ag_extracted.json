The world is now set to change at a pace not seen in decades, even centuries. \nAI-based tools and applications make our lives easier, smoother, and richer. They help us move efficiently, get informed, get credit, \nget a job, and get our taxes done.\nBut in its current form, AI reproduces and amplifies many of the social challenges we face. It is not acceptable that around a third of \nthe world’s population still lacks adequate internet access. Upstream, the AI industry is highly concentrated, with just two countries \n– the United States and China – and a dozen companies accounting for a major share of the sector. This can lead only to greater \ninequality of outcomes – including gender disparities – downstream. Non-diverse AI teams, unrepresentative datasets, and opaque \nand biased algorithms can cause harm, particularly to those who are already vulnerable, whether companies or individuals, children \nand young people, women, or entire democracies.\nThat is why UNESCO drafted the Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, which was adopted in 2021 by 193 \ncountries to make sure AI delivers fair, sustainable, and inclusive outcomes. The Recommendation is based on the protection and \npromotion of human rights, human dignity, and environmental sustainability, and these values are then translated into principles \nsuch as accountability, transparency, and privacy. The Recommendation also sets out concrete policy actions that governments can \ndraw on to steer technological developments in a responsible direction, premised on the belief that light-touch regulation, which \nhas until now remained the norm, is insufficient. We need capable governments that are well equipped, in terms of competencies, \ninstitutions and laws, to frame responsible AI development and protect the rule of law online, and public and private deve",

The social and cultural dimension focus on factors ensuring inclusiveness and social and cultural diversity, public awareness and values related to the scaling up of ethical AI solutions. Ensuring that AI systems do not contribute to the amplification of structural bias. This section therefore focuses on issues of gender inequality and the bias that may arise from a lack of representativity in datasets and embedded biases in algorithmic systems, due to a lack of diversity and gender equality in the teams designing and producing AI systems. DIVERSITY, INCLUSION AND EQUALITY According to recent data from the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), in regions with higher internet usage, such as the Americas, gender parity in internet access has been achieved or is near achievement. This is evident in many Caribbean nations, including Antigua and Barbuda, where the overall internet usage rate is relatively high, and the gender parity score is close to 1.0, signalling near equality in access between men and women (ITU, 2023). SIDS, including Antigua and Barbuda, are unique in that they tend to have a higher gender parity score compared to other low- income or less developed regions. While global averages show men using the internet more than women (70% men vs. 65% women), small island nations have a parity score close to 0.97, and in some cases, women even outnumber men in internet usage (ITU, 2023). However, it is essential to note that while Antigua and Barbuda and many Caribbean nations show progress, disparities still exist in terms of meaningful inte",

By implementing these strategies, Antigua and Barbuda can further improve its e-government development and enhance the delivery of public services to its citizens. When participants in the RAM consultations were asked about their trust in Government websites, one participant noted “I don’t think it’s a general trust. It’s just the data. How accurate and up to date is it?” This suggests that once information is current and truthful, it will be considered reliable and worthwhile for use. In terms of trust in AI, many participants of the multistakeholder consultations expressed scepticism about AI, particularly among older audiences who remain cautious about fully relying on AI systems. In contrast, younger individuals – who also engaged in a dedicated youth-focused consultation - are more enthusiastic about AI but raised concerns about over-reliance. This concern may also indicate the right mindset that is necessary for responsible use. Public trust in both government websites and AI can be built through transparency, regular updates, and clear communication. ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY POLICIES The Environmental Protection & Management Act of 2019 sets the groundwork for environmental protection in Antigua and Barbuda. Although it doesn’t directly mention AI, it could potentially guide the creation and implementation of AI solutions in fields such as environmental surveillance, resource administration, and pollution mitigation. Other laws such as the Fisheries Act of 2006, could be extended to include AI. Antigua and Barbuda recognises that AI for sustainability is a priority and can support environmental goals, such as climate resilience and early warning systems. However, the sustainability of AI itself, particularly its carbon footprint and energy use, also needs attention. Currently, there is no policy to",

The scientific and educational aspect of the RAM evaluates the nation’s current capacity in AI research alongside the state of AI-related education. RESEARCH AND INNOVATION Globally, as part of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), countries such as those in the Caribbean have pledged to dedicate at least 1% of the GDP to Gross Expenditure on Research and Development (GERD) to support research and innovation. According to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS), the GERD in 2020 for Latin America and the Caribbean is at 0.63 to 1.05 for SIDS, while the world average is 1.93. Looking at individual countries, there were no statistics for most of the Caribbean countries. Among countries with reported data, Trinidad and Tobago had the GERD of 0.06 in 2019, while Cuba recorded the highest at 0.52 in 2020 (Trading Economics, n.d.). Further details on the GERD can be seen in Table 1 below. Antigua and Barbuda does not have a well-established or any reported data on the GERD. Like many data-scarce regions, this data is available but not readily harvested. While the zero-budget allocation is alarming, it highlights the opportunity to better align developmental agendas with robust and rigorous scientific research. Antigua and Barbuda lacks documented or readily shared data on GERD in natural sciences and engineering as a share of GDP. According to data from Trading Economics website, Trinidad and Tobago does not specify gross expenditure on research and development on natural sciences and engineering as a share of gross domestic product, but the GERD was reported to be 0.05382% of the GDP in 2021; 13.19 USD million.

It covers aspects such as the labour market, intermediate consumptions etc. These are crucial aspects for evaluating the performance and readiness of the any country’s AI ecosystem. LABOUR MARKETS There is no figure that accurately reflects the share of job vacancies requiring AI skills (online) in Antigua and Barbuda. In places like Trinidad and Tobago there are over 9,000 remote job vacancies in AI-related skills.4 Similarly to most of the other Caribbean islands there is no publicly confirmed figure about the share of current employees working as data scientists in Antigua and Barbuda. However, according to Paylab, the position of a data scientist in the labour market for information and technology, is ranked 76th based on salary . 5This implies that there, is for sure, a job market for data scientists in Antigua and Barbuda, though there may not be a high demand for them. There is not enough statistical data within the Caribbean region to rank the countries regarding the relative AI skill penetration. According to OECD live data, most studies are focused on the larger Latin American and Caribbean countries like Dominican Republic, which is making a lot of efforts into developing their AI industry. Antigua and Barbuda does not appear in any global or regional rankings for AI talent concentration. The sector remains underdeveloped, resulting in limited data and statistics. However, according to the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC, 2024), a few AI companies have emerged in the Caribbean, particularly in St. Kitts and Nevis",
