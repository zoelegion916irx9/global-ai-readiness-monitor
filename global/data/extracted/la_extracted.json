Public inquiry processes for the deployment of mass-market and public-facing AI systems; 3. Certification standards and procurement procedures for AI vendors, particularly for public-sector use; 4. Audit access provisions to allow oversight authorities to review AI systems. In parallel, the government should clearly articulate the ethical values expected in AI development and deployment.

Moreover, given Laos currently has only two operational data centers, co-locating new ones along energy corridors presents a cost-effective opportunity. To address this, the government can embed universal service and broadband connectivity obligations into major infrastructure projects, particularly in sectors like energy, telecommunications, and mining. These obligations should be supported by regulatory and financial incentives to make rural expansion viable for private investors. It is important to note that many industry representatives were unfamiliar with government-led infrastructure and R&D incentive mechanisms. Consequently, it is identified that an initial awareness-building phase to expose companies to available schemes, coupled with targeted incentives, such as tax breaks, matching grants, and regulatory advantages, are needed to stimulate AI adoption and private-sector R&D.",

Its core responsibilities would include overseeing the implementation of the national AI strategy, harmonizing AI-related regulations, fostering multi-sector collaboration, and ensuring compliance with ethical standards. The government can build on the existing National Committee for Digital Transformation, which already brings 59 together ministries and agencies with structural representation on digital and computing matters, by extending its mandate to coordinate AI-related affairs.

To ensure these centers thrive within the existing top-down, grant driven nature research culture where researchers typically seek funding before developing research topics, it is crucial to actively engage donors and align their funding priorities with the goal of fostering collaboration, like pushing them to start cross- disciplinary AI research centers within universities.

This means continuing current efforts to integrate foundational knowledge of AI, including ethical decision- making, into national school curricula, civil service training programs, and journalism education. At the same time, to ensure inclusivity and broad public understanding, other stakeholders outside the school ecosystem should develop and widely disseminate a Lao-language AI primer tailored for the general public, minding socio-economic realities and using culturally relevant narratives and accessible formats - this can be done by government institutions, businesses, media networks and/ or civil society organization in context to their industry and vertical.
