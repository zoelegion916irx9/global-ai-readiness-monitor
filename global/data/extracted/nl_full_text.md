Clearly delineate how to address the use of AI under the exclusions of the AI Act and take a leadership position on the topic of human rights

### Recommendation 2: Under the AI Act, several sectoral exclusions are stipulated (defence and military, national security, scientific research
Under the AI Act, several sectoral exclusions are stipulated (defence and military, national security, scientific research and development). Some sectors come with specific provisions (law enforcement, public security, and open-source development). The exclusions are, for example, for national security, “justified both by the fact that national security remains the sole responsibility of Member States in accordance with Article 4(2) TEU and by the specific nature and operational needs of nationa

### Recommendation 3: Article 24). It is worthy to note that the exclusion does not apply to dual-use technologies (i.e. those also used outside
Article 24). It is worthy to note that the exclusion does not apply to dual-use technologies (i.e. those also used outside of the national security context) and that there is no clear definition of national security provided. The exclusions were debated extensively, both during the negotiation phase of the AI Act and by human rights groups.210 The Netherlands’ Stakeholder Team also highlighted caveats and potential weaknesses caused by the exclusions. Stakeholders mentioned the lack of clarity o

Veiligheidsdiensten, CTIVD) (retroactively) monitors the compliancy of the AIVD with the Wiv 2017. This includes activities with the use of algorithms and AI. To address the issue of artificial intelligence in autonomous weapon systems, the Netherlands actively engages in the

### Recommendation 6: Group of Governmental Experts on Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems (GGE LAWS) of the United Nations Office
Group of Governmental Experts on Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems (GGE LAWS) of the United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs (UNODA) as well as other pertinent international fora and conferences. During the period of 2024–2026, the Dutch disarmament ambassador serves as Chair of the GGE LAWS. A central topic of discussion within the GGE LAWS is the application of international law, particularly international humanitarian law. The Netherlands often emphasizes the significance of internationa

### Recommendation 7: Strategy prioritises investments in knowledge building in relation to ethical issues and meaningful human control, and
Strategy prioritises investments in knowledge building in relation to ethical issues and meaningful human control, and aims to improve regulation and supervision on the use of algorithms within ethical and legal frameworks. In the context of AI for military purposes this is realised by adhering to NATO’s Principles of Responsible Use, as stipulated in the (revised) NATO AI Strategy213, the main principle in this context begin lawfulness (“AI applications will be developed and used in accordance

### Recommendation 8: Netherlands co-hosted the second REAIM Summit hosted by the Republic of Korea. The REAIM Blueprint for Action
Netherlands co-hosted the second REAIM Summit hosted by the Republic of Korea. The REAIM Blueprint for Action affirmed the importance of international human rights law for the development, deployment and use of AI in the military domain.215

### Recommendation 9: Following a joint Call to Action that government representatives issued at REAIM 2023 in the Netherlands, in 2024 the
Following a joint Call to Action that government representatives issued at REAIM 2023 in the Netherlands, in 2024 the Netherlands and the Republic of Korea tabled the United Nations Resolution on AI in the military domain and its 212 Defensie Strategie Data Science en AI 2023-2027 | Rapport | Rijksoverheid.nl 213 https://www.nato.int/docu/review/articles/2021/10/25/an-artificial-intelligence-strategy-for-nato/index.html. 214 https://voorlichting.rijksoverheid.nl/ministeries/ministerie-van-buiten

### Recommendation 10: General Assembly.216 By endorsing this resolution States affirmed that international law, including the Charter of the
General Assembly.216 By endorsing this resolution States affirmed that international law, including the Charter of the United Nations, international humanitarian law and international human rights law, applies to matters governed by it that occur throughout the life cycle. The purpose of the UN resolution is to ensure that this issue is discussed more often and in greater detail by all the countries in the world. In the coming years, the Netherlands will continue to play a leading role in advanc

### Recommendation 11: Consider sovereignty on all layers of the technology stack in order to develop targeted efforts that
Consider sovereignty on all layers of the technology stack in order to develop targeted efforts that increase competitiveness and reduce dependencies In spite of significant regulatory efforts and governance initiatives on AI, the Netherlands’ Stakeholder Group suggested that efforts should take into consideration all layers of the technology stack model (Figure 0.1) in order to have an overarching approach to digital open strategic autonomy.217 Digital sovereignty leads to agency in deciding th

### Recommendation 12: Figure 0.1: (Simplified) technology stack model (adapted from Stolwijk et al., 2024).
Figure 0.1: (Simplified) technology stack model (adapted from Stolwijk et al., 2024). The ambiguity of regulating digital technologies has to do with their complexity and diversity. They involve multiple ingredients – data centres and graphic cards, networks and connectivity, data, and applications, and much more. In that context, it is worthwhile to consider complexity by means of a layered model.218 Once split into layers, it is possible 216 https://www.government.nl/latest/news/2023/02/16/rea

### Recommendation 13: Stakeholder Team is first to consider sovereignty on all of the layers and second, to develop targeted regulatory efforts
Stakeholder Team is first to consider sovereignty on all of the layers and second, to develop targeted regulatory efforts and policy initiatives that increase competitiveness and reduce dependencies. Government response

### Recommendation 14: Digital sovereignty is an important topic for the Dutch government. In 2023, the Agenda on Digital Open Strategic
Digital sovereignty is an important topic for the Dutch government. In 2023, the Agenda on Digital Open Strategic Autonomy (DOSA) was published.220 This agenda recognizes the increasing dependency on third countries for our digital technologies. The agenda has six stack levels: resources, hardware, physical infrastructure, soft infrastructure, data, and applications and services. On the basis of these stack levels, the agenda identifies several specific policy priorities: critical raw materials,

### Recommendation 15: Protection Regulation (AVG) has already shown that EU regulation is an effective instrument to safeguard public values
Protection Regulation (AVG) has already shown that EU regulation is an effective instrument to safeguard public values in education.221 The Dutch government has also recently mandated a study on alternatives for big tech platforms in education with a strong focus on public values such as privacy.222 The new Dutch Digitalisation Strategy (NDS) to be published in 2025 will continue to build on the work on safeguarding public values by the previous cabinet.223

### Recommendation 16: Formulate programs and initiatives for civic engagement in policymaking on AI
Formulate programs and initiatives for civic engagement in policymaking on AI The Stakeholder Team flagged a general lack of civic engagement in AI policymaking. The core argument made is that policy developments often follows a top-down approach, where expert groups, industry representatives, and government bodies lead decision-making without substantial input from the broader public or civil society groups. Although initiatives such as the Dutch AI Coalition emphasize collaboration, they are o

### Recommendation 17: Without mechanisms to make these processes more inclusive and accessible, such as public consultations, educational
Without mechanisms to make these processes more inclusive and accessible, such as public consultations, educational campaigns, or citizen assemblies on AI, there is a risk that AI policies will not adequately reflect the diverse concerns, values, and needs of Dutch society. This issue becomes of particular relevance in the case of AI being used for algorithmic-decision making.224 In response, the Stakeholder Team advised to formally integrate civic engagement programs and initiatives in the poli

### Recommendation 18: Additionally, the Dutch government aims to raise awareness about AI. For example, through the program Digitaal
Additionally, the Dutch government aims to raise awareness about AI. For example, through the program Digitaal Burgerschap (Digital Citizenship) of the Dutch Royal Library, libraries offer events and educational opportunities for citizens to learn about topics such as AI.225 Likewise, the Dutch government launched an educational campaign about digitalisation including on AI.226 The campaign was a collaboration between the government and DPG-media in which 400.000 citizens were reached. The DIGCO

### Recommendation 20: Several government bodies such as the municipality of Amsterdam, initiated initiatives to engage civil society. For
Several government bodies such as the municipality of Amsterdam, initiated initiatives to engage civil society. For instance, to engage discussions amongst actors and collect feedback, the Dutch government organised dialogue sessions on AI systems-use in the public sector with civil society and public sector officials. In 2023, together with civic organizations, the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations also organized ethical dialogues amongst several actors from Dutch society on specif

### Recommendation 21: Build on the government-wide vision on generative AI of the Netherlands and define best-practices
Build on the government-wide vision on generative AI of the Netherlands and define best-practices related to sustainability in AI development and use

### Recommendation 22: Even before the sudden surge of interest in generative AI, scientists had already flagged the considerable carbon
Even before the sudden surge of interest in generative AI, scientists had already flagged the considerable carbon footprint of AI. It is important to acknowledge that AI is destined to play a dual role. On the one hand, it can help to reduce the effects of the climate crisis – from optimising our energy grid to developing low-emission infrastructures.

### Recommendation 23: Yet, on the other hand, the carbon footprint of training AI models is considerable.231 Today, the “environmental impacts
Yet, on the other hand, the carbon footprint of training AI models is considerable.231 Today, the “environmental impacts are expected to escalate considerably, with the global AI energy demand projected to exponentially increase to at least 10 times the current level and exceed the annual electricity consumption of a country like Belgium by 2026”.232 In addition to the high degree of carbon emissions and electricity use, AI is also associated with substantial water consumption, ‘both directly fo

Ethics of Artificial Intelligence (UNESCO, 2021), UNESCO has advised against the use of AI if it may lead to disproportionally negative impacts on the environment.234 Therefore, it was advised by the Netherlands’ Stakeholder

### Recommendation 26: Team to make conscious evaluations should further investments be made into, for example, data centres or high-
Team to make conscious evaluations should further investments be made into, for example, data centres or high- performance computers. Government response The Dutch government pays special attention to the impact of AI on sustainability and climate. The government recognises that (generative) AI can contribute to solving climate challenges, but so far it has only led to an increase in the ecological footprint. Therefore, the Netherlands believes it is essential to make these technologies more sus

### Recommendation 27: Dutch government, sustainability is a key principle in the deployment of AI, meaning that this technology will not be
Dutch government, sustainability is a key principle in the deployment of AI, meaning that this technology will not be used if it causes significant harm to people and the planet. In 2024, Utrecht University was asked to conduct a study concerning the environmental impact of the use of generative AI by the public sector. Results of this study are expected in the beginning of 2025.

### Recommendation 28: More in general, the Dutch government is also committed to a sustainable digital infrastructure and the sustainability
More in general, the Dutch government is also committed to a sustainable digital infrastructure and the sustainability of other sectors through digitalisation. For this purpose, an Action Plan for Sustainable Digitalisation was drawn up in

Infrastructure.236 The Dutch government is working with sustainable frontrunners in the “National Coalition for Sustainable Digitalisation” to use their experiences more broadly for all entrepreneurs.

### Recommendation 31: Furthermore, the Energy and Sustainability working group of the NL AI Coalition will support the development of new
Furthermore, the Energy and Sustainability working group of the NL AI Coalition will support the development of new AI solutions to challenges in the energy sector and around sustainability, and thus stimulate the Dutch economy.237

### Recommendation 32: Moreover, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has mandated Dialogic to research the energy- and water usage of AI. The
Moreover, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has mandated Dialogic to research the energy- and water usage of AI. The goal is to analyse ways in which AI can be used in an energy-efficient manner. The study is expected to be published in May 2025. The Netherlands is also working with other EU Member States to exchange experiences around the dual transition of sustainability and digitalisation. A relevant fact is also that at EU level regulations in the field of circularity, recycling and reporting

### Recommendation 33: Explore the possibilities of establishing an advisory body of experts that monitors AI developments
Explore the possibilities of establishing an advisory body of experts that monitors AI developments beyond the AI Act 234 Beyond its exorbitant use of energy, AI is also associated with the consumption of large quantities of water (for server cooling and offsite electricity generation). In regions where there is already scarcity and the consequent risk for droughts are an important factor to consider (Hao, 2024). 235 Actieplan Duurzame Digitalisering | Rapport | Rijksoverheid.nl 236 Staat van de

### Recommendation 34: Given the expected exponential growth that (generative) AI will undergo in the coming years, it is of significant
Given the expected exponential growth that (generative) AI will undergo in the coming years, it is of significant importance for the Dutch government to closely monitor relevant developments. The Dutch government is, and will remain, in close contact with local governments, implementation organizations, knowledge institutions, commercial entities, public interest organizations, employers, employees, and citizens on this subject. Furthermore, the Netherlands will prioritize the implementation of

### Recommendation 35: Secondly, at the request of the House of Representatives, the Dutch government also explored the establishment of
Secondly, at the request of the House of Representatives, the Dutch government also explored the establishment of an AI advisory body at the highest (Dutch) political level intensively. However, the installation of an AI advisory body advising the government is subject to stringent laws on such advisory bodies, requiring careful deliberation and formal procedures. Such bodies and the way they can and cannot operate may not fulfil the need expressed by parliament.

### Recommendation 36: Additionally, because of the consequences for the labour market, both in terms of employment and the quality of
Additionally, because of the consequences for the labour market, both in terms of employment and the quality of work, the government has asked its Social and Economic Council (Sociaal-Economische Raad, SER) to advise on the impact of AI on labour productivity, quantity, and quality of work. In other words, several institutes and advisory body are already in place when it comes to specific aspects of the implications of AI.

### Recommendation 37: Thirdly, AI is developing at such a rapid and disruptive pace that it is necessary to look for new ways to translate
Thirdly, AI is developing at such a rapid and disruptive pace that it is necessary to look for new ways to translate knowledge and research into effective policy and to connect researchers with policymakers and the parliament. The government has worked on and continues to work on ways to address this issue through the development of a ‘Science for policy’ approach. Policies developed solely on the basis of scientific knowledge are ‘evidence-based’; ‘evidence- informed’ policy is developed when s

### Recommendation 40: Prioritise in the expansion of assessments and labs for responsible development of AI and in the
Prioritise in the expansion of assessments and labs for responsible development of AI and in the producing of new (general) tools The Netherlands’ Stakeholder Team flagged a discrepancy between the tools and assessments for the ethical / responsible / transparent development of AI and practice. Academics are well aware of the problematics with the panoply of existing guidelines, and the gap between ethics and practice. In a recent literature study, it was flagged that ethics in the context of AI

When turning to industry and business organisations, the symptoms are felt. Industry representatives within the Stakeholder Team flagged the need for more assistance in the implementation of the guidelines (and regulations). In response to these observations, it was recommended to prioritise the penetration of assessments and labs for responsible development of AI over the producing of new (general) tools. Government response

### Recommendation 42: Citizens and businesses must be able to trust that the government establishes appropriate frameworks and rules for
Citizens and businesses must be able to trust that the government establishes appropriate frameworks and rules for (generative) AI. In this regard, attention should be paid to how existing and upcoming legislation is capable of encouraging the development and use of AI in a safe and fair manner. Clear national, European (or international) frameworks can contribute to accelerating innovation. The European AI Act provides a solid foundation in this respect. In the coming years, practical tools and

Act, the Netherlands is in the process of establishing regulatory sandboxes. With these sandboxes, supervisory authorities enter into a regulatory dialogue with participants to assist them with AI Act related questions on the development, testing or validation of (high risk) AI systems. Such measures will help increase legal certainty, thereby stimulating innovation, and increasing the development and use of responsible and safe AI. As for the public sector, in recent years, the Dutch government

AI. In the Netherlands, municipalities where Big Tech companies are located have raised concerns over their interest in the region. The sentiment is shared that data centres are located strategically next to green energy wind parks to present users and investors with a sustainable and responsible image, even though these companies might be profiting unfairly from subsidised energy. This could lead to new inequalities as municipalities do not benefit from the green energy that is generated there

### Recommendation 49: Strengthening the AI ecosystem is also high on the European political agenda. On 24 January 2024, the European
Strengthening the AI ecosystem is also high on the European political agenda. On 24 January 2024, the European Commission launched the AI Innovation Package, which introduced the concept of an AI factory.252 The importance of investing in AI is also reflected in Mario Draghi's recently published report on the future of European competitiveness253, and the priorities of the new European Commission for the period 2024-2029.254 The Commission announced to ensure access to new, tailored supercomputi

Develop capacities to design policy that addresses digital and media literacy throughout all layers of society

### Recommendation 52: Digital literacy in marginalized communities remains a critical area for policy improvement, particularly in the age of
Digital literacy in marginalized communities remains a critical area for policy improvement, particularly in the age of AI, where divides can exacerbate existing inequalities.257 As AI-driven technologies become increasingly embedded in education, healthcare, and employment, those lacking basic digital skills are at a greater disadvantage.258 For marginalized groups, limited access to digital infrastructure and literacy means they miss out on opportunities to leverage tools that can enhance lear

### Recommendation 53: Technological developments, such as the development of generative AI, increase the production and dissemination of
Technological developments, such as the development of generative AI, increase the production and dissemination of disinformation. Distinguishing between reliable, objective and factual news and disinformation is becoming increasingly confusing. In addition, AI technology can facilitate microtargeting, posing risks both to privacy and personal autonomy. This necessitates further efforts to increase media literacy among various target groups in order to prevent less digitally adept people from fa

December 2024, the Netherlands has addressed the theme of better regulation in the digital domain and proposed to particularly discuss the burden for SMEs in next Council meetings. The Netherlands has also welcomed the announcement by the European Commission to prioritise an assessment that would identify whether the digital acquis – all agreed EU regulation in the digital domain - reflect the needs of SMEs. The Dutch government has called upon the European Commission to strictly enforce the eva

### Recommendation 58: Develop a coherent and unified strategy to retain and attract talent around AI
Develop a coherent and unified strategy to retain and attract talent around AI For the Netherlands, attracting AI talent from abroad is particularly important due to the country's ambitions. While it boasts a strong educational system, the Stakeholder Team has observed that the demand for specialized AI skills exceeds the supply of homegrown talent. To maintain its competitive edge in the global AI race, the Netherlands needs to attract top-tier international talent to bridge these gaps. 263 VNO

### Recommendation 59: Developing and retaining talent in the Netherlands is also a matter of ensuring diversity and inclusion, which is not yet
Developing and retaining talent in the Netherlands is also a matter of ensuring diversity and inclusion, which is not yet fully integrated into the country's AI sector. Although the Netherlands is known for its open, multicultural society, there is still work to be done in creating diverse teams that represent a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences. This diversity is essential for addressing biases in AI models and ensuring that the technology benefits all sectors of society266.

### Recommendation 60: European and global partners267, but there is room for more structured and frequent exchanges of expertise.
European and global partners267, but there is room for more structured and frequent exchanges of expertise. Strengthening collaborations with other hubs internationally and other parts of Europe can help the Netherlands remain at the forefront of AI advancements. Such exchanges—whether through academic partnerships, joint research initiatives, or cross-border innovation projects—will allow practitioners to continuously update their skills, learn from global best practices, and contribute to a sh

FOREWORD 
 
 
We have officially entered the Age of Artificial Intelligence. The world is now set to change at a pace not seen in 
decades, even centuries. AI-based tools and applications make our lives easier, smoother, and richer. They help us 
move efficiently, get informed, get credit, get a job, and get our taxes done. 
But in its current form, AI reproduces and amplifies many of the social challenges we face. It is not acceptable that 
around a third of the world’s population still lacks adequate internet access. Upstream, the AI industry is highly 
concentrated, with just two countries – the United States and China – and a dozen companies accounting for a major 
share of the sector. This can lead only to greater inequality of outcomes – including gender disparities – downstream. 
Non-diverse AI teams, unrepresentative datasets, and opaque and biased algorithms can cause harm, particularly to 
those who are already vulnerable, whether companies or individuals, children and young people, women, or entire 
democracies. 
That is why UNESCO drafted the Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, which was adopted in 2021 
by 193 countries to make sure AI delivers fair, sustainable, and inclusive outcomes. The Recommendation is based on 
the protection and promotion of human rights, human dignity, and environmental sustainability, and these values are 
then translated into principles such as accountability, transparency, and privacy. The Recommendation also sets out 
concrete policy actions that governments can draw on to steer technological developments in a responsible direction, 
premised on the belief that light-touch regulation, which has until now remained the norm, is insufficient. We need 
capable governments that are well equipped, in terms of competencies, institutions and laws, to frame responsible AI 
development and protect the rule of law online, and public and private developers who are accountable for putting 
human rights and fundamental freedoms – not profits or geopolitical considerations – first. 
The Readiness Assessment Methodology (RAM) is a diagnostic tool intended to assist Member States in upholding 
their commitment to the Recommendation by helping them understand how prepared they are to implement AI 
ethically and responsibly for all their citizens. By highlighting any institutional, regulatory, or data gaps and obstacles, 
it enables UNESCO to tailor support for governments to fill those gaps to ensure an ethical AI ecosystem aligned with 
the Recommendation. 
The Netherlands has followed the RAM to diagnose where they stand in relation to policy and other dimensions of the 
AI ecosystem, identify recommendations for national stakeholders, and take corresponding action. The Netherlands 
has made considerable investments – most notably, into science and education – and the government is in the process 
of incorporating the European Union’s Artificial Intelligence Act. Additionally, the Netherlands is committed to 
upholding the Council of Europe Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence (2024). Beyond the stage of the 
European Union, the Netherlands’ current national AI landscape features a number of ethical components engrained 
within policy, primarily within the third track of its Strategic Action Plan for Artificial Intelligence (2019). Within that track, 
it is highlighted that public values and human rights – notably, the prohibition of discrimination, protection of privacy, 
freedom of speech, human dignity and autonomy - remain protected under the law.

Within the United Nations’ E-Government Indexes 1, the Netherlands scores well on a worldwide stage. It scores above 
0.9 (out of 1) in all five indexes. The Netherlands also boasts good scores in the Coursera data science ranking, 
investments in AI research and cybersecurity indexes.2  
Overall, this report presents a fundamentally optimistic vision that we at UNESCO share: that ethical governance and 
responsible regulation of AI is entirely consistent with innovation and economic growth and is essential for ensuring a 
technological ecosystem that benefits the public good. With the RAM data and this report, the Netherlands has a clear 
roadmap for how to get there. 
It was a pleasure working with the Government of the Netherlands to conduct this exercise. We are grateful for their 
engagement with the RAM, and I am sure that by following the path laid out in this report, the Netherlands will be 
able to reap the benefits of AI while making sure that AI technologies deliver fair, sustainable, and inclusive outcomes.

Artificial intelligence is rapidly transforming industries, enhancing productivity, and driving innovation across the globe. 
As its impact grows, so does the need for a strong commitment to implementing AI in a way that is ethical, transparent, 
and responsible. The potential of AI to revolutionize fields such as healthcare, education, public services, and 
environmental sustainability is immense. Yet it also poses significant challenges, from privacy concerns to the risk of 
bias and inequity. Ensuring that AI serves our best interests requires a proactive approach that emphasizes 
accountability, fairness, and respect for individual rights. By upholding these principles, we can harness the power of 
AI to create a future that is both technologically advanced and socially just. 
 
The Netherlands is strongly committed to an ethical and responsible implementation of AI in all sectors of public policy. 
For example, the Netherlands ranks first in the 2024 Global Index on Responsible AI3, which analyses government 
frameworks, actions, non-state actors, human rights and AI, responsible AI capacities and responsible AI governance. 
We are proud of the Netherlands’ scientific achievements regarding the ethical aspects of new technologies, and our 
significant contribution to the preparation of UNESCO’s Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence as 
adopted in 2021. Implementing the RAM has benefitted the Netherlands by helping create an overview of 
organisations, programmes and actions related to AI. It demonstrates the important work that has been done, for 
example on the Algorithm Registry. It also points us towards areas for improvement, such as computing power, 
sustainability, and civic engagement. It offers inspiration for the National Digitalisation strategy that the Dutch 
government is currently preparing and will present in 2025, in which AI will be one of the areas to be covered. We 
hope that the Netherlands’ experiences and initiatives will inspire other UNESCO member states.  
 
In the Netherlands, the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science is responsible for the implementation of 
UNESCO instruments such as the Recommendation on the Ethics of AI. However, because of its coordinating role on 
digitalisation within the Dutch government and the nature of AI as a system technology that can be applied in every 
sector, we have intensively cooperated with the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations to provide their expertise

on national AI policy. There was also close cooperation with the Ministry of Economic affairs, responsible for most of 
the investment programs on AI and the coordination of the implementation of the AI Act. Most other ministries in the 
Dutch administration have also contributed to this exercise. The RAM report underlines the importance of close 
cooperation within the Dutch government, which we look forward to continuing in the upcoming years.  
 
We are very satisfied that this RAM report could be finalised in the week of the global AI Action summit organised by 
the France government (Paris, 10-11 February 2025), and will serve also in the same month as our input to the 
monitoring of the UNESCO Recommendation as planned this year. We want to emphasise that this report gives an 
overview of the situation in the Netherlands until mid-February 2025. Without doubt, there will be very soon many 
new policy developments given the enormous speed of the development of AI.  A new Dutch digitalisation strategy 
(NDS) will be one of them and released soon.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the way we produce, consume, and interact on a day to day basis. It is one of 
the ten key enabling technologies featured in the Netherlands’ National Technology Strategy.4 AI is pervasive in the 
sense that it is a system technology “characterized by a very broad degree of applicability in the economy and society, 
comparable to the role that electricity played in the 19th century or the combustion engine in the 20th century”.5 As a 
system technology, AI has the potential to boost competitiveness and is already in the process of transforming entire 
sectors; from applications for radiology in healthcare and advanced analytics in finance to personalised teaching in 
education and precision farming in agriculture. Notwithstanding, as is characteristic for system technologies, AI also 
brings with it a number of risks that need to be taken seriously.6 AI can feature contentious practices throughout its 
design and life cycle, from the deplorable conditions imposed on ‘click workers’ to the intrusive collection of data, and 
the violation of fundamental rights in the process.  
It is therefore that in November 2021, 193 UNESCO countries adopted the Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial 
Intelligence. This initiative is global and aims to provide States with a normative framework for supervising AI while 
taking stock of its opportunities. To do so, on the basis of the Recommendation, UNESCO has released the Readiness 
Assessment Methodology (RAM) tool to gather information about different dimensions related to a country’s AI 
landscape, including the legal and regulatory, social and cultural, economic, scientific and educational, and 
technological and infrastructural dimensions.  
In the Netherlands, applying the RAM offered an opportunity to diagnose policy, identify recommendations with 
national stakeholders, and take corresponding action. The Netherlands’ RAM report is the fruit of a close collaboration 
between the UNESCO Netherlands Commission (UNESCO NC), the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (OCW) 
and the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations (BZK). To ensure an objective data collection and evaluation, 
OCW and BZK commissioned the independent, statutory Dutch Organisation of Applied Scientific Research (TNO). 
The Ministries together with TNO, jointly devised an approach that reflects the consultative process recommended by 
the RAM (please refer to Appendix A for the approach and Appendix B for the national stakeholder team).  
In consideration of the Netherlands’ mature AI landscape, the implementation of the RAM consists of three consecutive 
stages: 
- 
Diagnosis 
- 
Multistakeholder evaluation  
- 
Recommendations and actions 
  
The Netherlands is one of the first European members of UNESCO to implement the RAM. Like other EU Member 
States, the government is in the process of incorporating the European Union’s Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act, 2024),

which is reflected in the outcome of the RAM exercise. The Act inherits the similar, foundational approach of the 
European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation such that it is based on upholding human dignity and protecting 
fundamental rights.7 Additionally, the Netherlands is committed to upholding the Council of Europe framework 
Convention on Artificial Intelligence (2024). The Convention is the first of its kind as it formulates fundamental principles 
and rules to safeguard human rights, democracy, and the rule of law during the development and use of AI. It is 
complementary to the already existing international human rights, democracy and rule of law standards and aims at 
filling-in any legal gaps. 
Beyond the stage of the European Union, the Netherlands current national AI landscape features a number of ethical 
components engrained within policy, primarily within the third track of its Strategic Action Plan for Artificial Intelligence 
(2019).8 Within that track, special attention is given to the fact that public values and human rights – notably, the 
prohibition of discrimination, protection of privacy, freedom of speech, human dignity and autonomy - remain 
protected under the law. The enshrinement and emphasis of human rights were also featured as part of the principles 
stipulated in policies like the Value-Driven Digitalisation Work Agenda and the Government-wide Vision on Generative 
AI of the Netherlands (2024). The Netherlands’ National Technology Strategy (2024) stipulates the ambition to better 
align AI developments with legislations and regulations.  
The social and cultural dimension of these policies features key elements that ensure AI is aligned with values and 
human rights. Specifically, it considers elements pertaining to diversity, inclusion, and equity, to public engagement 
and civic trust, to the countries' digital health policy,  cultural heritage and media policy. The Netherlands has historically 
demonstrated strengths in a number of these elements; notably, developed strong positions on questions of gender 
and LGBTIQ+ equality, civic participation, children’s rights, and the aforementioned digital health. As a consequence, 
in spite of challenges posed by the successful integration of civil society across all aspects in the AI lifecycle, it scores 
well on most of the indicators featured.  
Science and education play a key role in advancing developments in AI. By reference to indicators pertaining to 
research and innovation, the Netherlands has invested significantly towards (higher) education and institutions working 
at the cutting-edge of science and technology. The Netherlands boasts leading universities and is home to prominent 
interdisciplinary academics. There are numerous educational support organizations and digital education programs 
that, through public funding and private-public collaborations, have achieved in driving the ethical development and 
successful adoption of AI. As a consequence, the Netherlands consistently scores well above-average on quantitative 
indicators and indexes.  
The economic dimension of the RAM considers aspects supportive of AI developments and deployments within the 
broader landscape. Specifically, it considers indicators related to the labour market, intermediate consumption, as well 
as private and public investments. The Netherlands performs well, although the expectation is a shift in demand and 
supply of labour that ought to be addressed. In order to address these implications, the government is awaiting a 
report by the Social and Economic Council of the Netherlands.  Private investments too are relatively minor compared 
to other developed economies.  
The technology and infrastructure dimension of the RAM pertains to the (mostly physical) capacity of countries to 
develop and deploy AI. Here, elements such as computing power, connectivity, and standards play a role. The 
Netherlands has made and is making considerable investments into its infrastructure. It boasts one of the most 
advanced infrastructures supportive of digitalisation in Europe. Further investments into data centres and high-
performance computers are needed in response to increased demand for computing power.

In response to the RAM-analysis, the multistakeholder evaluation was largely positive. This success is primarily driven 
by the country’s robust and vibrant research and innovation ecosystem, where government, the private sector, and 
academic institutions work together seamlessly. In firm alignment with legislations and regulations, these collaborative 
efforts are regarded as key enablers of the country’s capacity to adopt and implement AI in a responsible and 
trustworthy way. 
In July and October 2024, two workshops were conducted with the Netherlands’ Stakeholder Team, composed of 
industry representatives, academic researchers, as well as civil society (refer to Appendix B). In the first workshop, 
opinions, and expectations on AI in the Netherlands were gathered to draw up a representative overview of the 
dimensions. In the second workshop, concrete feedback on the RAM and recommendations were requested from the 
stakeholder group. 
The main policy recommendations cover three principal axes: regulation, the institutional framework, and capacity 
building. As the Netherlands aims to take action on each of these, the outlook for the landscape remains contingent 
on a number of factors. First, the developments regarding technological sovereignty, geopolitical developments and 
the development of global governance of AI will have an impact on the perspective on AI policy. Second, as the Dutch 
government changed to a new coalition in 2024 with new budgetary priorities, which will impact the opportunities for 
research and innovation in The Netherlands in the long term. Thirdly, the available resources regarding both human 
capacity as well as computing capacity for the development of AI remains a challenge. Fourth, and lastly, the relation 
between appropriate frameworks and rules for (generative) AI and the support and trust experienced by citizens and 
businesses is a critical factor in the further development and use of AI.  
 
 
Recommendations 
1. 
Delineate how to address the use of AI under the exclusions of the AI Act and take a leadership position 
on the topic of human rights. 
2. 
Consider sovereignty on all layers of the technology stack in order to develop targeted efforts that increase 
competitiveness and reduce dependencies.  
3. 
Formulate programs and initiatives for civic engagement in policymaking on AI. 
4.

OVERVIEW OF THE DUTCH AI POLICY 
LANDSCAPE 
THE NETHERLANDS 
 
The Netherlands published its Strategic Action Plan for Artificial Intelligence (‘SAPAI’) in October 2019. It aims to ensure 
that the Netherlands is able “to capitalize on AI’s societal and economic opportunities, as well as to safeguard the 
public interests of AI, thus contributing to prosperity and well-being”.9 Following SAPAI, the Dutch government 
published two documents in which policy on AI was further developed in November 2022: the Value-Driven 
Digitalisation Work Agenda10, and the Digital Economy.11 AI was also featured in the Netherlands’ National Technology 
Strategy (2024). As of November 2024, a new Netherlands’ Digitalisation Strategy (NDS) is being developed that will 
build on the current Dutch policy framework as described below in Table 0.1.

Policy 
Description 
2024 
National Technology Strategy 
The National Technology Strategy provides building blocks for a 
strategic technology policy by identifying key technologies where the 
Dutch knowledge field and industry can make a positive impact, and 
which are in line with existing strengths and opportunities.  
2025 
 
 
Netherlands 
Digitalisation 
Strategy (NDS) 
 
 
The NDS will enable the Dutch government to jointly and integrally work 
on digitalisation policy, and it provides society and the Dutch Parliament 
with insights as to the government-wide commitment to digitalisation. It 
will be a way to ensure that existing policies can be implemented more 
quickly, that there is no duplication of efforts, and that tasks that need 
an impulse can be tackled more quickly.  
In the Netherlands, the governance of AI related policies involves different ministries, supervisory and advisory bodies. 
This can be explained by the broad and profound impact of this technology across various sectors and layers of 
government, society, and the economy, requiring both generic as well as sector specific initiatives. The division of tasks 
and roles within the Dutch government evolves over time, reflecting the challenges and political developments in the 
Netherlands.  
Ministries 
The Dutch Minister for Digitalisation has a coordinating role regarding national digital policy alongside its own 
competence of overseeing the use of AI and digital governance in the Netherlands’ public sector. The Minister of 
Economic Affairs (EZ), the Minister of Digitalisation (BZK), and the Minister of Justice and Security (JenV) are jointly 
responsible for the government-wide national AI policy including preparing negotiations for the Netherlands’ 
contribution to European or international AI regulations. Other ministries provide input on AI related issues when these 
relate to their specific policy areas. For example, the Minister of Education, Culture and Science (OCW) is responsible 
for the Dutch positions in UNESCO. The Ministry of OCW, whose own competences include culture, media, education 
and science policies, is also the coordinating ministry regarding emancipation policy. The Minister of Foreign Affairs 
(BZ) has an overall responsibility for the coordination of the Dutch positions in the European Union and global fora 
such as the United Nations, and is responsible for Dutch contributions and diplomacy with regard to global AI 
governance, AI in the military domain, and an open, free and secure cyberspace.  
Municipalities, provinces and water authorities  
After central government, the main administrative layers are the municipalities, provinces and water authorities. On a 
national level, the municipalities are represented through the Association of Dutch Municipalities (Vereniging van 
Nederlandse Gemeenten, VNG), provinces through the Association of Dutch Provinces (Interprovinciaal Overleg, IPO), 
and water authorities through the Dutch Water Authorities (Unie van Waterschappen, UvW). These organisations 
provide their members with tools and information for the use of new technologies such as AI. Provinces, municipalities 
and water authorities also have the freedom to support their own initiatives, as long as these comply with national and 
European regulation. For example, the Association of Dutch Municipalities has written a position paper in which it calls 
for more attention to the process of implementation of the European Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act, 2024) at the 
municipal level.12 The Association also published a report about the impact of the AI Act on municipalities.13

In the currently being developed new National Digitalisation Strategy, specific efforts will be directed at collaboration 
between the different layers of government. This collaboration aims to provide a more collective approach to 
digitalisation. One example is the Netherlands government’s view on using generative AI. Initially focused on the 
national government, this is currently being redeveloped as a joint policy for all of the public sector.  
Parliament  
In 2021, a new cross-cutting standing committee on Digital Affairs was established within the Netherlands’ House of 
Representatives.14 In 2024, a similar committee was established within the Netherlands’ Senate.15 The committee was 
established to support the Parliament in understanding all facets of digitalisation and its impact on society. In the 
committee new technologies such as AI are discussed, as well as digital citizenship, ethics, infrastructure, online safety, 
and cybersecurity.16 As an example, ein 2024, Parliament asked the Netherlands government to publish a report on 
the risks and measures of resilience in relation to AI and democratic rule of law and to develop an AI diplomacy 
strategy (expected mid 2025).17 Similarly, Parliament requested in 2023 for the government to develop an integrated 
vision on the use, potential and risks of new AI products, such as generative AI.18 This government-wide vision was 
published early 2024.19 
Monitoring and supervisory bodies  
The Dutch Data Protection Authority (Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens, AP) monitors compliance with applicable data 
protection laws, which also apply to algorithms and AI when personal data are processed. Since 2018, the Authority 
works together with other European national data protection authorities in the European Data Protection board (EDPB). 
In 2023, a separate organisational unit was created within the AP to coordinate algorithmic oversight: the Department 
for the Coordination of Algorithmic Oversight (DCA). The DCA oversight contributes to better control of algorithms 
and AI, by for example providing overarching risk analysis, strengthening cooperation between regulators, and 
contributing to the development of guidance for regulations that include an algorithm component. The focus of the 
coordination of algorithmic oversight is on better protecting fundamental values and rights during the development 
and deployment of algorithms. Since its establishment and at the time of writing (December 2024), the DCA has issued 
three reports on developments concerning the risks related to algorithms and AI20 . In its recent fourth edition (February 
2025), overarching developments, fundamental rights and public values, policy and regulations, AI chatbot apps and 
AI literacy are being discussed21.

Together with the digital supervisory authorities, the AP and the RDI have advised the Dutch government on how to 
set up the supervisory structure for the AI Act, publishing a number of policy documents relating to this matter. The 
most recent and final advice was published in November 2024.22 
 
The Netherlands Institute for Human Rights is an independent monitoring human rights institute which explains, 
protects, and promotes human rights in the Kingdom of the Netherlands (including the Caribbean Netherlands), and 
handles discrimination complaints. The Institute has published several papers on (the risks in) the use of AI. Examples 
include a research paper on algorithms and discrimination in the context of recruitment23, a position paper on the 
need for transparency with the use of algorithms by governments24, and an opinion on discrimination and exclusion 
caused by the use of AI in education.25  
Advisory bodies 
Several advisory bodies can be consulted by the Dutch government when it comes to challenges around AI or provide 
advice on their own initiative. Below is a selection of advisory bodies.  
The Netherlands Scientific Council for Government Policy (Wetenschappelijke Raad voor het Regeringsbeleid, WRR) is 
an independent advisory body for government policy. Its task is to provide science-based strategic policy advice to 
the Dutch government and Parliament on strategic issues that are likely to have significant long-term social and political 
consequences. In the publication Mission AI – The New System Technology26, the WRR offered a new perspective on 
this theme. The government provided a written reaction to this publication in October 2022.27 
In 1986, the Dutch government founded an institute that was given the specific task to research the impact of 
technology on society, the Rathenau Institute. The Rathenau Institute aims to contribute to shaping a society that 
utilises digitalisation democratically, and in which everyone can participate. On 28 July 2020, this institute organised a

Cooperation between the Dutch Authority for Digital Infrastructure and UNESCO 
The Authority for Digital Infrastructure (Rijksinspectie Digitale Infrastructuur, RDI) advises on laws regarding digital 
infrastructures, implements regulations and monitors compliance with those regulations. In 2023, UNESCO’s Social 
and Human Sciences Sector, the European Commission and the RDI launched a project Supervising AI by 
Competent Authorities, financed through the European Commission’s Technical Support Instrument (TSI). With 
support from UNESCO, the RDI chairs the European working group on AI supervision. RDI and UNESCO also work 
together towards a framework for a global governance of supervision on AI. Furthermore, the RDI oversees an AI 
Safety and Security Lab. In this lab, the risks of generative and general purpose AI in particular are investigated, in 
collaboration with other AI Labs such as the UK and US Safety Labs.

regional consultation with UNESCO stakeholders from West Europe and North America about the draft UNESCO 
Recommendation on AI and ethics. Recently, Rathenau Institute published a report on the impact of generative AI.28  
Specific advisory bodies also exist for education policy (Education Council) and research and innovation policy 
(Advisory Council for Science, Technology, and Innovation, Adviesraad voor Wetenschap, Technologie en Innovatie). 
The advisory council for education issued an advice about the impact of intelligent technologies like AI on education 
in 2022.29 
Public-private cooperation 
The Netherlands embraces public-private collaboration around the topic of AI. The most impactful collaboration is the 
Dutch AI Coalition (Nederlandse AI Coalitie, NL AIC).30 Set up in October 2019, on the initiative of VNO-NCW MKB-
Nederland, EZK, TNO, Seedlink, Philips, Ahold Delhaize, IBM, and Topteam Dutch Digital Delta, the Coalition is a 
network of more than 500 public-private partners exchanging knowledge and deploying it in the responsible use of 
innovative AI applications in various domain-specific areas. SMEs are also involved and supported in AI through seven 
regional AI hubs. Since January 1, 2025, the Dutch AI Coalition and the public-private multi-year AiNed31 have joined 
forces under the name AI Coalition 4 NL (AIC4NL).32 
 
THE EUROPEAN AND INTERNATIONAL 
CONTEXT 
 
The Netherlands aligns its AI policy with the European Commission’s AI strategy and related policies to ensure 
consistency and mutual reinforcement. Within the European Union, numerous policies in relation to digitalisation were 
adopted in the last decade (Table 0.2). For AI specifically, it is important to highlight the adoption of the Artificial 
Intelligence Act (AIA) which came into force 1 August 2024 (AI Act, 2024). The Act, which is the first of its kind, establishes 
a common regulatory and legal framework for the design, development, and use of AI within the European Union. 
The integration ensures that the country's AI development aligns with broader EU objectives and frameworks. In doing 
so, and at its very core, the Netherlands addresses potential risks of AI development and deployment to citizens' 
health, safety, and fundamental rights. In addition, the European Declaration on Digital Rights and Principles as signed 
on 15 December 2022 is worth mentioning (European Declaration on Digital Rights and Principles for the Digital 
Decade, 2022). The Declaration presents the European Union’s commitment to a secure, safe, and sustainable digital 
transformation through technological breakthrough in for example AI that puts people at the centre, in line with core 
EU values and fundamental rights. 
To ensure the EU stays on track to meet its digital transformation ambitions, EU countries need additional investments 
in digital skills, high-quality connectivity, and uptake of AI. These are the main conclusions of the second report on the 
State of the Digital Decade.33 It assesses the progress made in achieving the digital objectives and targets set for 2030 
by the European Union’s Digital Decade Policy Programme. The report also analyses EU countries’ national strategic

roadmaps that detail the planned national measures to contribute to the European Union’s digital transformation. The 
Netherlands brings a very strong contribution to the European Union’s Digital Decade objectives and targets. In 2023, 
The Netherlands made notable progress in basic digital skills, particularly with regards to strengthening knowledge of 
digitalisation and digital tools. However, important challenges persist in filling the ICT specialists’ gap and close 
attention should also be given according to the European Commission to companies’ continued adoption of advanced 
technologies, such as artificial intelligence and cloud.

convention on AI 
First worldwide convention which formulates fundamental principles and rules 
to safeguard human rights, democracy, and the rule of law during the 
development and use of AI. It is complementary to the already existing 
international human rights, democracy and rule of law standards and aims at 
filling-in any legal gaps. 
 
International dimension: global AI governance 
The governance of AI raises geopolitical questions which relate to the international order. For the Netherlands, this 
necessitates intensive cooperation with EU Member States and with countries outside of the EU. Cooperation with like-
minded countries on aspects such as human rights (such as the right to privacy, to information and to non-
discrimination) and personal and international security in relation to the development and use of (generative) AI is 
important. The Netherlands is internationally active in the field of AI, including in international organisations where 
standards and principles for human-centered AI are developed. The Netherlands actively maintains contact with 
countries outside the EU to strengthen understanding and support for human-centered AI. Through these channels, 
the Netherlands advocates for safety and correct interpretation of rules for AI. The Netherlands does this from a values-

driven approach, in which the Netherlands is committed to safe AI and protection against risks, so that the 
opportunities of this technology can be optimally utilized. 
International fora other than UNESCO that play an important role in this include the United Nations General Assembly, 
the G7 Hiroshima AI process and, within the European region, the Council of Europe's Committee on AI (CAI). At a 
global level, the United Nations is working on AI governance in the UN. The multi-stakeholder High-level Advisory 
Body on AI (HLAIB) of the UN Secretary-General has 39 members, including two Dutch, and recently delivered a final 
report.34 Within the G20, AI was on the agenda in 2023 under Indian chairmanship, for example in the context of 
education and digital skills, in which the Netherlands actively participated.  
The Netherlands was a member of the first iteration of the Global Partnership for AI (GPAI). The GPAI and the OECD 
AIGO working party were recently integrated under the integrated Global Partnership on AI.35 This renewed integrated 
partnership has been established to promote cross-border cooperation between countries and experts.36 The 
Netherlands has participated in the OECD Global Strategy Group on the discussion of global AI governance.  
The Netherlands is committed to negotiating agreements on the military use of AI. As a result of the REAIM Summit, 
an international ministerial conference on responsible use of AI in the military domain37, the Netherlands has worked 
towards a broadly supported standard setting. The Call to Action was supported by more than 50 countries and served 
as the basis for the recent second REAIM summit organised in 2024 by South Korea.38 The Netherlands, together with 
South Korea, and based on the outcomes of the REAIM summits, submitted the very first resolution on this topic to 
the United Nations. This resolution was adopted on 6 November 2024.39 Netherlands is also working on setting up the 
Global Commission on Responsible use in the military domain.  
The Netherlands is also the founder of the international Freedom Online Coalition40, under which the Task Force for 
AI and Human Rights functions, which keeps issues relating to AI and human rights on the agenda at international 
conferences.  
At the request of parliament41, the Netherlands government has published a report on the risks and measures of 
resilience in relation to AI and democratic rule of law42, and will develop an AI diplomacy strategy (expected mid 2025). 
CURRENT STATE OF PLAY 
 
As the report shows under 1.1, the Netherlands’ policy on AI dates back to 2019. Both nationally and internationally, 
the Dutch focus has been on stimulating innovation in (human-centric) AI and the promotion of ethical, trustworthy, 
and responsible use of AI with respect for fundamental rights and consumer protection, based on a well-developed 
legal framework. 
Ethical, trustworthy and responsible AI 
The Dutch government has developed a variety of non-binding tools for the public sector which are aimed at ensuring 
that the implementation of AI is done in a transparent and responsible manner. These were initiatives prior to the

publication of the European Commission’s proposal for an AI Act. These instruments help (government) organisations 
apply existing laws and regulations during the design, development, and use of AI-systems. Examples of such tools for 
the public sector include the Handbook non-discrimination by design43, an e-learning non-discrimination, the 
Fundamental Rights and Algorithm Impact Assessment44, and the Code of Good Digital Government.45  
Seeing the variety of tools developed in recent years, the Dutch government published a framework aimed at public 
sector bodies, providing insights as to which (legal) conditions are in place for the responsible use of algorithms and 
AI. The framework encourages better implementation of laws and regulations pertaining to AI and algorithms by 
creating an overview and giving guidance for all phases of the life cycle of algorithm and AI deployment. The 
framework also gives users practical tools and examples as to how to comply with regulations. 
An initiative aimed at increasing transparency about the use of AI and algorithms is the Dutch algorithm registry for 
the public sector, which was launched at the end of 2022.46 In this central registry, all layers of government publish 
data about the algorithms and AI systems they use in their activities, such as how those systems work. The information 
is publicly available and aims to strengthen trust of civic society in the public sector’s use of algorithms and AI. At the 
time of writing (December 2024), the registry holds over 600 algorithms. By the end of 2025 all central government 
bodies need to have their high-risk AI systems (in the sense of the AI Act) registered in this central registry. 
At the beginning of 2024, at the request of the House of Representatives, the Dutch government presented its 
government-wide vision on generative AI.47 Both the widespread availability of generative AI, its scale, and the pace 
at which the technology is currently developing, require a future-proof vision. The government-wide policy document 
on generative AI was developed in collaboration with the public sector, CSOs, businesses, education institutions, AI 
developers and citizens. It describes the opportunities and risks associated with generative AI. It also addresses relevant 
laws, regulations, and policies. Lastly, the vision contains a set of concrete actions to ensure responsible development 
and use of generative AI that benefits society. Considering the importance of this rapidly evolving topic, these 
discussions will continue to evolve. 
Human-centric innovation 
The digital economy is one of the priorities and important responsibilities of the Minister of Economic Affairs. For this 
end, the Digital Economy Strategy was published in 2022.48 The Strategy focuses on five pillars: 
1. 
Stimulating digitalization in SMEs  
2. Stimulating digital innovation and skills 
3. Creating the right framework conditions for well-functioning digital markets and services 
4. Maintaining and strengthening a safe and resilient digital infrastructure 
5. Strenghtening cybersecurity

In practice, this strategy has led to several best practices for ethical and responsible AI innovation. The partnership of 
the Dutch AI Coalition (NL AIC) and the AiNed programme, funded from the National Growth Fund strives to stimulate 
innovation with AI. This approach is a good example of collaboration as it is cross-sectoral, with the commitment from 
seven regional AI hubs to also involve SMEs.49 Since January 1st 2025 the NL AIC and AiNed initiatives have merged 
into the AI Coalition 4 NL (AIC4NL) program. The NL AIC was the driving force behind the ELSA labs network which 
researched AI in different domains with a focus on ethical, legal, and societal aspects. Furthermore, in early 2023, the 
programme ROBUST for the realisation of 17 new AI research labs and 170 PhD students in the field of reliable machine 
learning started.50  
AI is also going to play an increasing role in education. The National Education AI Lab (NOLAI), based at Radboud 
University, co-develops intelligent digital education innovations aimed at improving the quality of primary and 
secondary education. NOLAI also investigates the pedagogical, societal, ethical and social consequences of intelligent 
digital education innovations.51 
At the European level, the European Commission is co-funding Testing and Experimentation Facilities (TEFs) for AI 
through the Digital Europe programme. TEFs are specialised large-scale reference sites open to all technology 
providers across Europe to test and experiment at scale state-of-the art AI solutions, including both soft-and hardware 
products and services, e.g. robots, in real-world environments.52 The Netherlands is also active in the European Digital 
Innovation Hubs (EDIHs) which focus on the application of advanced technologies in small and medium enterprises 
(SMEs). The Ministry of Economic Affairs co-finances projects within the EDIH, together with the Digital Europe 
programme.53 To stimulate European language models, the Netherlands has also become a member of the Alliance 
for Language Technologies - European Digital Infrastructure Consortium (ALT-EDIC). Input can be provided on the 
basis of the development of GPT-NL, a Dutch large language model for public purposes.

The Fundamental Rights and Algorithm Impact Assessment (FRAIA)54 
In August 2024, the AI Act entered into force, setting European-wide requirements and obligations for the 
development and use of AI-systems with risks. During the negotiations, the Netherlands successfully made proposals 
to strengthen the position of citizens and to strengthen the regulatory sandbox framework. The Dutch government is 
currently in the process of setting up supervision on the AI Act. Part of these efforts are the establishment of the 
regulatory sandboxes. these sandboxes, supervisory authorities enter into a regulatory dialogue with participants to 
assist them with AI Act related questions on the development, testing or validation of (high risk) AI systems. 
Summary 
Since the first Dutch AI strategy from 2019, the Dutch focus for AI policy in recent years has been on promoting an 
ethical, trustworthy, and responsible use of AI with respect for human rights and consumer protection, while at the 
same time fostering innovation in (responsible) AI. While the emphasis was initially on the development of national 
non-binding instruments to apply existing laws and regulations on development and use of AI-systems, from 2025 on 
the Netherlands will have to comply with the provisions of the European Union AI Act.  
In recent years, the Dutch government promoted and supported various research activities on ethical, legal and 
transparency aspects of AI and highly values collaborations and public-partnerships (PPPs) on AI, the Netherlands 
brings a very strong contribution to the EU’s Digital Decade objectives and targets and ranks first in the 2024 Global 
Index on Responsible AI, which analyses government frameworks, actions, non-state actors, human rights and AI, 
responsible AI capacities and responsible AI governance. Several investment initiatives related to AI and generic tax 
schemes for companies/SMEs are ongoing, with recent significant contributions from the Dutch National Growth Fund.  
 
54 https://www.government.nl/documents/reports/2024/06/20/fraia-in-action  
The Fundamental Rights and Algorithms Impact Assessment helps to map the risks to fundamental rights in the 
use of algorithms and to take measures to address this. FRAIA is the English translation of ‘Impact Assessment 
Mensenrechten en Algoritmes (IAMA)’. FRAIA creates a dialogue between professionals who are working on the 
development or deployment of an algorithmic system. The government organisation in question that is planning 
to start a project with algorithms for the implementation of FRAIA. 
 
The result of this tool is that all relevant points for attention when using algorithms are addressed in a timely and 
structured manner. This prevents organisations from using algorithms of which its consequences are not yet clear. 
FRAIA also aims to reduce the risks of carelessness, ineffectiveness or infringements of citizens’ rights. 
 
With FRAIA, the Netherlands tries to take a leadership position on the topic of human rights and the use of 
algorithms and AI. FRAIA has also been tested in a variety of pilots. These pilots show that FRAIA most often leaves 
a positive impression, despite possible prior scepticism. However, participants sometimes found the process time-
consuming, some questions less relevant, and had participants had difficulties with involving all the necessary roles. 
In the evaluation report from June 2024 of the pilots, several recommendations are shared to improve FRAIA. 
 
Examples of these recommendations are to develop a ‘pre-FRAIA’ or ‘quickscan’ for organisations to decide if they 
should conduct the impact assessment, as well as updating FRAIA to align the tool with the European AI Act. 
Another recommendation focused on process of conducting FRAIA, where it was stated that good guidance during 
the process is essential. A process facilitator can be beneficial, allowing to raise the right points and to ask the right 
questions.

The Netherlands has developed as one of the first countries worldwide a government-wide vision on generative AI 
(January 2024), where the government collaborated with a wide range of stakeholders (such as industry, academia, 
local governments, civic society). To enable all of Dutch society to benefit from AI, it is important for the Netherlands, 
as part of the EU, to be proactive and forward-looking. Dutch policy on AI is deeply embedded in European AI policies 
and regulation. Additionally, the Netherlands is committed to upholding the Council of Europe framework convention 
on Artificial Intelligence (2024).

LEGAL AND REGULATORY 
This section will examine the legal and regulatory aspects of Artificial Intelligence. Establishing a robust regulatory 
framework is essential for ensuring the ethical use of AI systems. Such a framework must provide mechanisms to 
protect citizens' rights, address unforeseen negative consequences, and offer remedies where necessary. Key 
components of this framework include laws on AI governance, data protection and privacy, data sharing and 
accessibility, and freedom of information, among others. 
The regulatory dimension is strongly embedded in the European context. The Netherlands was actively involved in the 
negotiations about several legislative proposals on digitalisation and supports the regulatory framework these laws 
offer. Subsequently, European legislation is used as a starting point for national rulemaking. For AI, this pertains to the 
AI Act, Digital Services Act, Digital Market Act and Data Act, while the older privacy legislation of the EU (GDPR) is 
highly relevant as well. 
 
 
AI POLICY AN D REGULATION  
AI POLICY AND REGULATION 
 
Strategic Action Plan for Artificial Intelligence (SAPAI) 
In 2019, the Strategic Action Plan for Artificial Intelligence was published. This plan describes the government's intentions 
to accelerate the development of AI in the Netherlands and to profile the Dutch activities internationally. It discusses 
AI developments in the Netherlands, the elements needed to further stimulate AI innovation, and safeguarding public 
interests in AI developments. 
The Action Plan establishes three thematic tracks that serve as national strategy fundamentals (Figure 0.1). Track 1 
focuses on capitalizing on societal and economic opportunities, highlighting AI’s ability to address societal challenges, 
enhance government efficiency in public tasks, and stimulate AI entrepreneurship. Track 2 emphasises creating the 
right conditions, with the Netherlands leading in high-quality AI research and innovation in Europe. The country offers 
excellent training for living with AI and developing talent for AI-related work. Furthermore, the Netherlands enhances 
AI development through abundant usable data and boasts superior digital and intelligent connectivity. Track 3 aims at 
strengthening foundations by ensuring the protection of public values and human rights, fostering trust in AI, 
maintaining open and competitive markets with robust consumer protection, and safeguarding the safety of citizens, 
businesses, and government entities.

Figure 0.1: Tracks of the Strategic Action Plan for Artificial Intelligence. 
Value-Driven Digitalisation Work Agenda 
In November 2022, the Minister for Digitalisation published on behalf of the Dutch government the Value-Driven 
Digitalisation Work Agenda. This Agenda focused on the conditions for value-driven implementation and digitalisation, 
with an eye for both opportunities and risks. The Agenda was based on the understanding that everyone should be 
able to participate, maintain trust in digitalisation and have control over their digital lives, with a government that sets 
a good example, seizes value-driven digitalisation opportunities and pays attention to all parts of the Kingdom of the 
Netherlands.  
These ambitions were translated into five tracks (Figure 0.2). Priorities within the tracks were identified and indicated 
where the focus would be in the coming year. Each priority had its own objectives and activities that together made 
the shared ambitions become a reality. 
Capitalising on societal and economic opportunties
• AI offers solutions for 
societal challenges
• The govenrement makes 
optimal use of AI in the 
performance of public 
tasks
• AI entrepreneurship is

Figure 0.2: The five tracks of the Value-Driven Digitalisation Work Agenda (2024). 
Policy and regulation initiatives on algorithms and AI were part of the third track (“everyone controls their digital life”). 
According to the track, everyone must know when parties or institutions used algorithms to reach a ‘decision.’ A few 
of the actions the track referred to, were the already mentioned Algorithm Supervisory Authority and the algorithm 
registry. In addition to this, the Agenda committed to (governmental) organisations performing fundamental rights 
impact assessments, drawing up procurement conditions for algorithms purchased by the government from third 
parties, and contributing to international negotiations (such as within the EU, Council of Europe, the United Nations).  
European Union’s Artificial Intelligence Act 
The most notable regulation on AI in the Netherlands and the broader European Union is the Artificial Intelligence Act 
(AI Act, 2024) which establishes a common regulatory and legal framework on the design, development and use of AI 
systems. The Act came into force on 1 August 2024, with provisions gradually becoming effective over the following 6 
to 36 months.  
The AI Act is risk-based and categorises AI applications by their risk of causing harm in terms of levels and imposes 
corresponding requirements and obligations (Table 0.1). There is an additional category for general-purpose AI, and 
in particular large-language models such as GPT, the model behind ChatGPT.55 ChatGPT was launched after the 
original Commission proposal and the additional provisions on general-purpose AI were introduced later during the 
negotiations between the EU-institutions.

The Council of Europe Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence and Human Rights, Democracy and the Rule 
of Law  
Between April 2022 and March 2024, members of the Council of Europe’s Committee on Artificial Intelligence (CAI) 
worked on an AI framework convention that aims to regulate the development, design and use of AI systems, based 
on Council of Europe standards on human rights, democracy and the rule of law. The negotiations were concluded in 
March 2024. The resulting text contains obligations for Parties to uphold important principles when deploying AI, such 
as transparency, protection of privacy and protection against discrimination. In addition to the recently adopted 
European Union’s AI Act, this convention offers added value as the first global convention on AI regulation. In 
September 2024, the convention opened for signature and was signed by the European Commission on behalf of the 
EU. In addition, Andorra, Georgia, Iceland, Norway, Moldova, Montenegro, San Marino, the United Kingdom, Canada, 
Israel, Japan and the United States signed.57 
The CAI is currently working on HUDERIA, a methodology for the risk and impact assessment of AI systems from the 
point of view of human rights, democracy and the rule of law. This is a non-binding annex to the AI convention that 
can help Parties with the implementation of this convention by taking measures to identify and mitigate human rights 
risks. This methodology was adopted by the Committee on 28 November 2024.58 
 
 
 
56 These AI-systems may also be categorized as high-risk AI systems which makes these obligations cumulative.

In addition to the AI Act, the Netherlands has additional (non-AI specific) regulation that is applicable in the 
development and use of AI. The General Data Protection Regulation is one example of such regulation  and forms the 
cornerstone of Dutch data protection law. Together with Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European 
Law and with the law enforcement directive, the GDPR forms the basis of EU privacy law and human rights law. The 
GDPR is directly applicable in all EU Member States. Additionally, the Netherlands has implemented some provisions 
of the GDPR nationally in what is known as the Uitvoeringswet Algemene verordening gegevensbescherming.  
The efficacy of data protection laws, including the GDPR, is periodically assessed by various entities such as the 
European Commission and national data protection authorities. In the Netherlands, the Dutch Data Protection 
Authority conducts regular evaluations and publishes reports. Under the GDPR, several rights and obligations are 
guaranteed. Some are presented in Table 1.5.  
Table 0.5: Data protection and privacy regulations under the GDPR.  
Statement 
Article 
Under the GDPR, individuals have significant control over their personal 
data. This includes the right to access, rectify, delete (the "right to be 
forgotten"), and restrict processing of their data. 
GDPR Article 17  
Right to erasure ('right to be 
forgotten') 
The GDPR requires that organizations obtain informed consent from 
individuals before processing their personal data, except in specific 
circumstances where consent is not required (e.g., legal obligation, 
contractual necessity).

Statement 
Article 
The GDPR mandates that organizations provide clear and transparent 
information to individuals about how their data is collected, used, and 
processed. 
GDPR Article 12  
Transparent information, 
communication, and modalities 
The GDPR incorporates the principle of purpose limitation, which means 
that data is collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and 
not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those 
purposes. 
GDPR Article 5(1)(c)  
Principles relating to processing of 
personal data 
Under the GDPR, a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) is required 
in situations where data processing is likely to result in a high risk to the 
rights and freedoms of individuals. 
GDPR Article 35  
Data protection impact 
assessment 
Under the GDPR data subjects have the right not to be subjected to a 
decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, 
which produces legal effects concerning the data subject or similarly 
significantly affects the data subject. There are limited situations in which 
this right is not applicable (listed in paragraph 2 of Article 22). 
GDPR Article 22 
The GDPR includes specific provisions for the processing of special 
categories of data (sensitive data), such as health or biometric 
information, requiring stricter conditions for processing. 
GDPR Article 9  
Processing of special categories of 
personal data 
The GDPR establishes enforcement mechanisms through the national 
data protection authorities. In the Netherlands, the AP can issue fines 
and sanctions. Individuals also have the right to seek compensation for 
damages resulting from violations. 
GDPR Article 82  
Right to compensation and liability 
The GDPR is known to exemplify the “Brussels Effect,” a phenomenon where the European Union’s regulatory standards 
extend beyond its borders, compelling companies globally to comply with its rules to maintain access to the European 
market.60 By setting high benchmarks for data privacy, the GDPR has influenced international data protection practices, 
highlighting the European Union’s capacity to shape global policies through its regulatory frameworks. The AI Act too 
has the potential to bring about yet another Brussels Effect.61

DATA SHARING AND ACCESSIBILITY 
 
The Netherlands ranks 10th in the global Open Data Inventory (ODIN), which ‘assesses the coverage and openness of 
official statistics to identify gaps, promote open data policies, improve access, and encourage dialogue between 
national statistical offices and data users’.62  
The Digital Markets Act (DMA, 2022) and the Digital Services Act (DSA, 2022) are key legislative frameworks introduced 
by the European Union to regulate digital platforms and ensure a fairer and safer online environment. Together, the 
DMA and DSA represent a comprehensive approach to modernizing digital regulations, ensuring that both 
competition and safety are upheld in the rapidly evolving digital landscape.63 The DMA targets large online platforms, 
known as gatekeepers, to prevent them from abusing their dominant positions. It imposes rules to foster competition, 
such as prohibiting self-preferencing, mandating data sharing with smaller rivals, and ensuring interoperability. 
Gatekeepers include companies like Google, Apple, and Facebook.64 The DMA aims to level the playing field, stimulate 
innovation, and provide more choices for consumers by curbing monopolistic practices and promoting a diverse digital 
market. 
The DSA focuses on ensuring a safe, predictable and trusted online environment across all digital services, from social 
media platforms to online marketplaces. It introduces due diligence obligations as regards the way these online services 
should tackle illegal content and other harmful activities. The obligations are adapted to the type, size and nature of 
the intermediary service concerned. Very large online platforms are obliged to identify and mitigate systemic risks, 
such as the dissemination of disinformation. The DSA also mandates more transparency by requiring clearer terms of

AI privacy issues in education 
As a result of digitalisation, the use of education software platforms (EdTech) by schools, and consequently minors, 
has increased significantly in recent years. Increasingly, more (personal) data are stored and exchanged on digital 
platforms. Individual schools are faced with the task to assess and possibly mitigate privacy risks associated with 
data processing by large international software vendors, in order to comply with the European data protection 
rules (GDPR, 2016). If not properly done, personal data could be collected in education institutions without schools 
or individuals knowing. The use of AI makes the use of digital platforms even more complex from a privacy 
perspective. Protecting personal data is of course especially crucial for minors in schools. An important duty in this 
context is to conduct Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA hereafter) as required under the GDPR for 
activities which are likely to involve “a high risk” to other people’s personal information.  
 
The Netherlands realised improved conditions for the protection of personal data in agreement with international 
software vendors, which attracted international media coverage. But these conditions not automatically applicable 
to (other education institutions in) other Member States/EEA Countries, despite the uniform European legislative 
framework. The Flemish and Dutch education ministers addressed this issue in a letter to the European Commission 
and introduced this in the EU’s Council of Education ministers (EYCS) of 23 November 2023. The letter suggested 
supporting enhanced collaboration at European level, to avoid the need for each Member State to devote a 
significant amount of time, expertise, and resources for negotiations with Big Tech firms in particular. The letter 
also requested the inclusion of this topic in the agenda of the European Commission. During the Belgian EU 
Presidency in the first half 2024, first steps had been taken in this regard.

service, content policies and recommender system transparency better protection of users' rights, robust content 
moderation systems and transparency reporting. The DSA further contains several redress mechanisms for users, 
ensuring more control for users over their online presence.  
The Data Act aims to make more data available for the benefit of companies, citizens, and public administrations. The 
most impactful measures are that users of connected products get the right to use and share data from their products 
and that a framework is created for customers to effectively switch between different providers of cloud services a 
cloud service providers should enable.  Additionally, the Data Act contains measures to mitigate the abuse of 
contractual imbalances and rules that enable public sector bodies to access and use data in situations of exceptional 
need. The Netherlands is currently in the process of transposing this legislation.  
Beyond European regulations, the Dutch approach to data sharing emphasizes interoperability, standardization, and 
the creation of trust frameworks to facilitate data exchange between different entities, including public and private 
sectors. There are several initiatives and frameworks that support national data sharing, particularly in the context of 
data exchange between public and private sectors (and within the private sector itself). A key framework is the Centre 
of Excellence for Data Sharing & Cloud.65  
The federative system of registries is used in the Netherlands for data exchange between organisations in the public 
sector. Currently, the federative system of registries is being developed to ensure that government registries, among 
other things, contain data that is correct and reliable, and that the data can be shared in an interoperable and 
transparent way.66 Furthermore, methods are being developed to ensure that open data can be shared within and 
outside the public sector in a way that fits the need of the recipient, depending on the context of the data request. An 
important aspect of these methods is that data sharing is transparent to, and if possible, within the control of, the 
citizen (e.g. wallets). 
 
PROCUREMENT LAWS AND POLICIES  
PROCUREMENT LAWS AND POLICIES 
 
The Netherlands has in place laws and policies related to the public procurement of AI systems. Notably this is an ‘AI 
module’ as part of the public procurement framework for the Dutch central government when procuring high risk AI 
systems.67 This framework can also be applied outside of the Dutch central government, but this is not mandatory. 
These policies align with broader European Union guidelines, particularly the AI Act, and aim to ensure responsible 
and ethical use of AI in public procurement. The efficacy of AI procurement policies is evaluated through ongoing 
studies and reports by governmental bodies and independent organizations. 
In recent years, the government established several communities of procurement professionals focusing on the 
procurement of AI-applications. These communities exchange information on best practices and publish guidelines 
and practical guidance.  
Currently, there is no official national list of certified vendors specifically for AI-related products. However, the 
development of certification schemes and vendor listings is being explored, especially in the context of the AI Act, 
which will likely require certification for high-risk AI systems. The certification for AI systems is anticipated to be 
mandatory for these applications, particularly those used in public services or critical sectors. For lower-risk applications, 
certification may be voluntary but recommended.

FREEDOM OF  INFORMATION ACTS AN D ACCESS TO KNOWLEDGE ACTS  
FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACTS AND ACCESS TO KNOWLEDGE 
 
On 1 May 2022, the Open Government Act (Wet Open Overheid, 2024) came into force. It replaced the Government 
Information (Public Access) Act (Wet Openbaarheid van Bestuur, 2018). The Open Government Act ensures that citizens 
can gain insight into the Dutch government’s actions when applicable. In the Netherlands, relevant public sector 
information must be accessible to the public, for example background documents that lead to decision-making. 
Therefore, citizens can request information about the way AI systems are used, except for when the requested 
information is classified by law as unsuitable for public disclosure, for example when security interests are at stake.  
The Dutch Court of Auditors (Algemene Rekenkamer) and other independent organisations have conducted 
evaluations to measure the impact and effectiveness of these laws in promoting transparency and accountability. For 
example, an evaluation was carried out one year after the Open Government Act came into effect. The evaluation 
explored the work needed to ensure that the regulations work properly. It concluded that there are different obstacles 
as many government organizations have trouble correctly implementing the Act: insufficient implementation is partly 
due to lacking capacity and a high burden to the workload; a lack of prioritization for information requests; best 
practices are not always applied; the Act leads to a ‘juridification’ of the relation between government and citizens.  
 
DUE PROCESS AN D ACCOUNTABILITY 
DUE PROCESS AND ACCOUNTABILITY 
 
The primary law protecting due process rights in the Netherlands are in the Dutch Constitution and the European 
Convention on Human Rights. Together with other laws such as the Dutch General Administrative Law Act, these rules 
safeguard procedural fairness, the right to a fair trial, and legal protections against arbitrary government actions. 
In addition to the fact that citizens can request information about governmental decisions as described under 2.5, 
governing bodies are required to proactively inform citizens about the reasoning and process behind administrative 
decisions affecting them (Article 3:46 General Administrative Law Act; Council of State AERIUS I and II cases.68 This 
includes some information about the algorithm or AI and the specific choices in the data made that were used in 
decision-making. Currently, the government is discussing possible revision of the General Administrative Law Act to 
further clarify obligations on governing bodies in this regard.69 
The AI Act contains a comparable obligation in Article 26(11). According to this provision, “deployers of high-risk AI 
systems […] that make decisions or assist in making decisions related to natural persons shall inform the natural persons 
that they are subject to the use of the high-risk AI system.” This obligation applies to public (which certain legal 
exceptions) and private deployers, and it is not limited to decisions by certain governing bodies. This obligation only 
requires deployers of high-risk AI systems to inform natural persons of the mere fact certain AI systems were used. 
However, Article 86 of the AI Act provides the right to explanation of individual decision-making to “any affected 
person that is subject to a decision which is taken by the deployer on the basis of the output from a high-risk AI 
system”. 
In addition to such an obligation, there are other transparency obligations in the AI Act for deployers of AI systems. 
The Act mandates that individuals must be informed when they are interacting with AI systems (chatbots), or when

content is generated or manipulated by AI (deepfakes) (Article 50). Currently, no specific national law mandates 
disclosure of AI interactions in all situations, but transparency principles from the GDPR and ethical guidelines from 
the Dutch National AI Strategy encourage informing individuals about the use of AI. 
The Netherlands does not yet have a specific national law dedicated exclusively to monitoring, redress, and remedy 
mechanisms against harms caused by AI systems, as these are included in current sectoral laws that apply to the 
relation between natural persons on the one hand, and the organisations using AI on the other, for example through 
administrative, tort, consumer, and human rights law. The AI Act outlines requirements for risk management, 
transparency, and accountability in AI systems, including a right to explanation of individual decision-making for those 
affected by such decision when high risk AI-systems have been used.  
The GDPR also provides mechanisms for redress and accountability related to automated decision-making and data 
processing, including rights to rectification, erasure, and compensation (see Table 1.5). It also grants data protection 
authorities the power to investigate and require access to information about automated decision-making systems. 
Additionally, under the AI Act, there are explicit provisions for oversight authorities to request detailed information 
about high-risk AI systems, including documentation on their development, functioning, and impact.70 
 
 
ONLINE SAFETY, INTEGRITY OF  SPEECH, AND CYBERSECURITY 
ONLINE SAFETY AND INTEGRITY OF SPEECH 
 
 
The In 2022, the government published the government-wide strategy for disinformation. The strategy consists of two 
tracks: first to strengthen free and open public debate, and second to reduce online disinformation. Within these tracks, 
the premise remains that freedom of expression and freedom of the press are central and the labelling of 
disinformation as such and fact-checking is primarily not a task of governments. The strategy was updated in June 
2024 with new measures in view of changing social and technological developments, such as the spread of 
disinformation by AI tools.  
The Netherlands announced it was conducting a broad exploration of the effects of disinformation on Dutch society. 
This research, which takes place during the next two years, will also contain a scoping study into the impact of 
generative AI and disinformation on journalistic processes in the Netherlands and a foresight study into new 
technologies for the production, spread and consumption of disinformation.

Started in 2017, RADIO is the National Academy for Digitalization and Government Informatisation. It is responsible 
for offering various trainings and courses to promote and improve the digital skills of civil servants. The (expected) 
impact is increasing the (general knowledge) about digitalisation for civil servants and improving and updating the 
knowledge of civil servants that already work in IT positions. The offer for directors and top managers has been 
expanded to include special courses for boards of directors and executive and management teams. The demand for 
this course has increased sharply recently.  
Furthermore, for civil servants from the central government the I-Vakmanschap program74 (I-professionalism) is 
developed. Through this program, there are various projects aimed at improving the Digital Government. A selection 
of these projects is featured hereafter: 
• 
I-Partnership: this is a government-wide program in which we increase the influx of young I-talent by 
committing to student assignments, through sustainable collaboration between government organizations 
and educational institutions.  
• 
Government I-internship: This is part of the I-Partnership together with both government organizations and 
educational institutions. As a result, students are linked to an ICT-related internship assignments within the 
central government.  
Innovation for the digital government, among AI, is being carried out decentralized across various governmental 
organizations. The innovation budget plays an important role in stimulating the development of AI within digital 
government and policy.75 Each year, through a selection process, 15 to 20 projects are chosen to receive co-funding. 
These projects must be innovative and executed in collaboration with one or more government entities, ensuring a 
collaborative approach to tackling public sector challenges. Based on this budget, there is increased collaboration and 
synergy between different stakeholders, such as government bodies, academic institutions, and the private sector 
Furthermore, the innovation budget ensures that AI-innovation is properly supported with the necessary resources, 
assistance and network to succeed. By encouraging cross-sector partnerships and promoting continuous 
experimentation, the innovation budget helps build a dynamic ecosystem where AI technologies can be harnessed to 
create more effective and transparent public services.

SOCIAL AND CULTURAL  
DIVERSITY, INCLUSION AN D EQUTY 
DIVERSITY, INCLUSION AND EQUALITY 
 
This section explores the social and cultural dimensions, which are essential for evaluating ethical aspects of AI system 
deployment. These dimensions focus on preventing biases throughout the AI lifecycle and fostering a fair, inclusive AI 
ecosystem. Key topics covered include the participation of women in science, technology, engineering, mathematics 
(STEM), and AI development, along with the integration of social and cultural diversity to promote ethical AI use. 
Furthermore, this section examines public attitudes and trust in AI, and the emphasis on health, social well-being, and 
cultural considerations in AI solutions such as the use of AI for preserving cultural heritage. Outside the scope of the 
suggested RAM indicators, we have also considered Dutch policies related to AI and the media in line with policy area 
9 communication and information in the 2021 Recommendation on the ethics of AI.  
The most recent Dutch policy document concerning gender and LGBTIQ+ equality policy is the Gender and LGBTIQ+ 
Equality Policy Plan 2022-2025. It pays attention to the fact that the world is becoming increasingly digital and 
algorithms are increasingly being used in society, and that this entails from an emancipation perspective both risks 
and opportunities. In terms of risks, one can think of an increase in (unseen) discrimination due to, for example, non-
representative training data, black box effects, stereotypical ideas in the rules of the algorithm or a belief in the 
objectivity of algorithms that does not correspond to reality. It is considered important that existing inequalities are 
not maintained or increased using algorithms. A balanced composition of the working population working in the ICT 
sector could also contribute to this, as could increased awareness among creators and users of algorithms do. The 
policy document also identified opportunities with algorithms: by running a large data set through the algorithm, it 
can be demonstrated that there is indeed systematic discrimination that can then also be counteracted, and when 
algorithms are built and used in the right way, they can counteract people’s (unconscious) prejudices. 
The Dutch government recently sent the first literature study to the Dutch that explores the cross-section between AI 
and LGBTI+ emancipation to the Dutch parliament76. It was found that there is still little research and knowledge in this 
area. The experts expressed concerns about the storage, confidentiality, transparency, representativeness, 
heteronormativity, and the human rights test of existing datasets. Through awareness and regulation it should be 
possible to get a better grip on these legitimate concerns. The study also underlined the importance of involving 
stakeholders from the start and in consultation to arrive at policies, innovations and action perspectives that are 
inclusive and do not (un)intentionally exclude LGBTI+ people. Important stakeholders are investors and companies, 
ministries, science and knowledge institutes, the national AI coalition and above all LGBTI+ communities and interest 
groups. When designing and implementing AI systems it is important to continuously keep an eye on the vulnerable 
position of LGBTI+ people; the value of AI should not simply be taken for granted. It is important to critically assess 
the use of AI, together with all parties involved, to determine how it can contribute to the inclusion and, ideally, the 
emancipation of LGBTI+ people, without unintended effects and harm.

Digital equity 
On the subject of digital equity, the Netherlands operates within the European context. Women are currently under-
represented in the European ICT sector, as in other areas of STEM. Currently, only 1 in 3 STEM graduates and 1 in 5 
ICT specialists are women.77 The EU’s 2022 ‘Digital Compass & Digital Decade Policy Programme 2030’ sets specific 
targets for 2030, including to the target of employing 20 million ICT specialists in the EU by 2030. While the percentage 
of girls choosing STEM at school has risen somewhat in the Netherlands over the past years, numbers vary greatly 
between vocational and other study programmes.78 In vocational education, female participation in STEM has risen 
from 7% to 9% over the last ten years. For male students, it rose from 44% to 46%.79 In the same time period, female 
students at universities rose from 25% to 27%, with male students rising from 44% to 45%.80 To deal with  the labour 
shortage in STEM and ICT and to give women and girls the chance to benefit from the economic opportunities these 
sectors offer, the government is committed to attracting women and girls to these sectors.  
 
In the Netherlands, there is a relatively large gender difference in career choices, as determined in an advisory report 
by the Dutch Education Advisory Council81 and also shown by the Technology Pact Monitor Data.82 Girls and women 
are most underrepresented in STEM (including ICT) and drop out early in the ‘talent pipeline.’ Currently, the share of 
women working in a technical profession in the Netherlands is 14%. The government implements several programs to 
ameliorate gender segregation, notably:  
- 
Alliance ‘Becoming who you are’: (€4.25 million);  
- 
Technology Pact:83 with school boards, the private sector, employers and employees, and local authorities;  
the Action Plan for Green and Digital Jobs (Actieplan Groene en Digitale Banen)84 aiming to increase 
investment in digital skills, education and development, and the number of female ICT specialists.  
- 
Sterk Techniek Onderwijs (STO (Strengthening Technical Education)) and Techkwadraat: STO is a program 
(2025-2028, approx. €100 million/per year structural) aimed at technical preparatory secondary vocational 
education, with attention to breaking through gender bias as a new mandatory component85. The National 
Growth Fund programme Techkwadraat is a comparable program (total budget approx. € 350 million, partly 
conditional) aimed at technical education in all primary education86. 
- 
National Strengthening Plan Microchip Talent (Project Beethoven, 2024).87 In the covenant between the 
government and Brainport, Region €50 million has been earmarked for, among other things, untapped labor 
potential, including women for the microchip sector.88

industry, and academia are all actively engaged in fostering a trustworthy AI ecosystem, emphasizing transparency, 
ethics, and human-centric approaches.  
 
Figure 0.1: Percentage trust in AI companies (2024).90 
Ethics and trust are central to the AI discourse in the Netherlands. Institutions such as the Rathenau Institute, SER, 
TNO, the WRR and Waag conduct research on the societal impact of AI, advocating for transparency and 
accountability in AI systems.  
Academic contributions 
Dutch universities (of applied sciences) are at the forefront of research, emphasizing the importance of trust in their 
studies. They collaborate with industry and government to develop AI solutions that are not only innovative but also 
ethically sound. Research projects often explore the societal impacts of AI and propose frameworks for responsible 
AI usage.  
Regulatory environment 
The Netherlands aligns its AI policies with broader European Union regulations, such as the GDPR and the AI Act. 
These regulations, and the role of supervisory bodies such as the Dutch privacy authority in this context, provide a 
legal framework that supports the ethical use of AI and protects citizens' rights. Compliance with these regulations is 
seen as a cornerstone for building trust in AI systems.91 
Public engagement 
Building trust in AI also involves engaging the public in discussions about AI technologies and their implications. The 
Netherlands encourages public dialogue through forums, workshops, and educational initiatives such as through 
Platform for the Information Society (ECP), that organised several workshops in 2023 with the public to discuss 
(potential) applications of generative AI. In addition, the Rathenau Institute will set up a ‘Digital Society Dialogue 
Programme’ in which it will organise panels, small expositions, and dialogues with the public to discuss digital 
developments in society including (applications of) AI.

To raise public trust in technologies such as AI it is important to increase the knowledge and awareness of citizens 
about such technologies. With the programme Digitaal Burgerschap (Digital Citizenship) of the Dutch Royal Library,92 
libraries get training and support to help citizens to improve the knowledge and understanding of the impact of 
digital technologies among its citizens, including AI.  
Additionally, the Dutch government works with the Alliantie Digitaal Samenleven (Alliance Digital Society) to close the 
digital divide (2025 will be the last year). This is an alliance with public, social and private partners to support people 
with the problems they encounter in the digital world. Their projects include the development of inclusive Dutch 
language detection models, as well as creating public awareness of the risks and benefits of AI.  
Scores on indexes 
Within the Open Data Inventory (ODI), 93 the Netherlands scores well on a worldwide stage. It is ranked on place 10 
in 2022/23. The ODI assesses the coverage and openness of official statistics to identify gaps, promote open data 
policies, improve access, and encourage dialogue between national statistical offices and data users. Within the 
United Nations’ E-Government Indexes, the Netherlands scores above 0.9 (out of 1) in all five indexes.94 Within the 
inclusive internet index 2022 of the Economist, the Netherlands ranks 8th in the overall rankings, with 3rd highest 
scores in availability, and 5th in readiness of the public to use internet facilities.95

ENVIRONMENTAL  AND SUSTAINABILITY POLICIES  
ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY POLICIES 
 
 
The Netherlands strives to be at the forefront of the transition towards low-carbon sources of energy and mitigate 
negative impacts on the climate. For this purpose, one of the goals formulated as part of the Value-Driven Digitalisation 
Work Agenda96 is: “Digitalisation and measures taken to improve sustainability must be mutually reinforcing”. An action 
plan for sustainable digitalization (2024) was published, focussing on three lines of action: making the digital sector 
more sustainable, using digitalization to make other sectors more sustainable and creating the rights conditions to 
make the first two lines of action successful. The action plan contains 44 actions that focus on making the digital 
infrastructure itself more sustainable and on the opportunities that digitalisation offers for sustainability in other sectors. 
In the action plan there is special attention for the exemplary role of the government IT-landscape. 
In the government wide vision on generative AI, an action was formulated to look into the sustainability impact of 
generative AI (on energy, water, erosion, pollution) and to formulate measures to mitigate such impact. Currently, this 
research is being carried out.  
The Netherlands also takes into consideration the risk that AI potentially poses to food systems, for example, 
automation that overlooks certain aspects impacting animal and plant life. In the ELSA Lab for Sustainable Food 
Systems (AI4SFS), a testing environment is created for the responsible development of sustainable food systems. The 
aim of the lab is to develop, test and apply a methodology for (re)designing AI for sustainable food systems. The 
methodology includes (a) the systematic identification and exploration of ethical, legal and social aspects of AI in 
specific domains in the food sector, and (b) the co-creation with quadruple helix stakeholders of responsible and 
human-centred AI for SFS.97 
 
DIGITAL HEALTH POLICY 
 
 
AI and healthcare 
Leveraging There are several ways in which AI can be used in healthcare. For example, AI is already used for radiology 
applications, and generative AI is being experimented with as a consultant in cancer treatment.98 It can also be used 
to perform repetitive and administrative tasks, such as summarising patient conversations and completing patient 
records, among others.  
The Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport commissioned TNO for a report on the opportunities and risks of using 
(generative) AI.99 The report highlights the potential of AI for easing the administrative burden, which supports the 
goal of the Minister of Health, Welfare and Sport to cut the time for administrative tasks by half in 2030.100 In addition, 
this report also calls attention to the new challenges posed by the use of generative AI in healthcare. These include

challenges such as fragmentation in developing and scaling up AI applications and in validating the accuracy and 
completeness of applications with generative AI.  
In 2025, the Ministry will work with the healthcare field on an approach and policy framework towards safe deployment 
of AI in administrative healthcare tasks.101 This approach will focus on: 
- 
Better identifying the potential time savings from the use of AI systems and joining forces across sectors, 
including by holding roundtable discussions with the healthcare field; 
- 
Encouraging better validation of AI applications within healthcare to ensure they are safe, effective and 
reliable; 
- 
Jointly determining how to accelerate the safe implementation of AI applications and what is needed to get 
healthcare AI ready, by making agreements on this matter. 
Digital well-being 
Education 
At the end of 2022, the European Council adopted conclusions on digital well-being in education.102 It invites Member 
States, depending on their national context, to integrate the well-being aspect into digital skills education and in the 
design of digital learning methods and environments, taking into account various factors such as students with special 
challenges and the digital gender divide. The European Commission is also invited to contribute to this, within its own 
competences. This includes the implementation of the Action Plan on Digital Education 2021-2027103 and new proposals 
in this context, conducting research into the impact of digital learning resources on student well-being, and using EU 
programmes to further strengthen digital well-being. 
Regarding the use of technology and well-being, the ban on mobile phones in secondary education in the Netherlands 
in January 2024 can be mentioned. The ban is based on a national agreement; a legal ban was not immediately 
chosen, because creating and implementing a law would take longer. The main aim of the ban is to enhance learners’ 
well-being and learning abilities by only allowing mobile phones when it is necessary for the content of the lesson. 
There are also exceptions allowed if devices need to be used for medical reasons, or disabilities. A first study of the 
ban in secondary education shows promising results.104 High school students are more social with each other and 
follow lessons more focused now that smartphones are banned from the classroom. This is according to teachers and 
school leaders of almost 600 high schools in a survey. After summer break 2024, the ban came into effect in primary 
and special education schools.  
Media literacy 
The Netherlands is also making a financial contribution to improving media literacy, notably to the Media Literacy 
Network which has over 1000 partners.105 This network wants to centralise access to knowledge, information and 
initiatives and is committed to putting the theme on the agenda and developing a central, accessible website that 
meets the wishes and questions of parents. This project also includes a study of parental restraint when it comes to 
media education. Media literacy is also a topic which is high at the EU agenda, The Audiovisual Media Services Directive

(AVMSD) requires EU Member States to promote and take measures to develop media literacy skills and to report on 
their efforts every three years.106 The EU has also published guiding documents.107  
Mental health policy and the digital balance 
In June 2022,  the Mental health approach for all of us.108 was launched. Concrete goals of this approach include 
ensuring that young people and parents better recognise the opportunities and dangers of the online world and that 
mental support is better aligned with the online world of young people. Also at the level of the EU mental health in 
relation to the digital transitions receives attention. On 7 June 2023, the European Commission published a 
Communication on the Comprehensive Approach to Mental Health.109 In both the Commission's integrated approach 
and the adopted Council conclusions,110 attention is paid to digitalisation and social media as a determinant of mental 
health. The Netherlands encourages the importance of research on this theme in an international context. 
Children’s rights online 
In the Letter to Parliament of 14 June 2023 on children's rights and digitalisation from the Minister for Digitalisation 
also on behalf of the State Secretary of Health, Welfare and Sport, the Dutch government has described in more details 
its vision and strategy regarding protecting children’s right online.111 Although AI is not specifically mentioned, AI is a 
system technology that increasingly operates in the online world that children are active in.  
A Children’s Rights Impact Assessment (KIA) and an updated Code of Children’s Rights have been developed. These 
support developers of digital services in developing age-appropriate designs, while minimising the risks of violating 
children’s rights. Children's rights impact assessments are currently being carried out on Instagram, TikTok and 
Snapchat. In addition, the Netherlands is working on strengthening research in this area by establishing the National 
Expertise Centre for Digitalisation and Health.112 In this letter, the Dutch Minister for Digitalisation also responds to the 
recommendations from essays written for a UNICEF symposium on children's rights in the digital world. UNICEF 
advocates strong legislation, both national and international, robust policies and adequate monitoring.113 A recent 
update of Dutch policies in this area was sent to Dutch parliament in December 2024.114 
The EU has also launched the Better Internet for kids strategy115, which rests on three pillars. Under pillar 1, the European 
Commission wants to ensure that the digital world is safe for children; an internet that protects against seeing things 
that make children scared, sad, or uncomfortable. Pillar 2 deals with the skills, knowledge and support a child needs 
to feel safe on the internet and use it properly. Finally, Pillar 3 looks at children's participation. The Dutch government 
wants to develop pillar 3 by setting up a youth panel by the end of 2024.116

The culture and media sectors were covered by a working group of the Dutch NL AI coalition.117 The working group 
dealt with the opportunities and challenges of AI for the culture and media sectors, and more specifically with issues 
such as privacy and security, but also the increasing market power of big technology companies. It has also formulated 
requirements for an AI ecosystem for the culture and media sector, conceived from public values and with an eye for 
the earning capacity of the sector.  
Digital heritage and AI 
The Netherlands is working towards greater accessibility  of digital heritage based on the decentral principles which 
are guiding the National Digital Heritage Strategy 2025-2028.118 AI is part of this strategy in as far as it states that 
heritage data should be published in such a way that that they are easily findable and legible for both humans and 
computers. Specifically, the strategy promotes the use of the standard Schema.org to display data and Linked Data 
standards for connecting them at the source.  
National partners collaborate at  the European level with Europeana, which has been awarded the tender for the 
deployment of a dataspace for cultural heritage. The Dutch Digital Heritage Network (Netwerk Digitaal Erfgoed) takes 
part in a number of European working groups, which contributes ideas on how this data space can operate in a more 
decentral way. In the last two years, the Dutch government has also invested in a supporting infrastructure for 
improving the quality (enrichment, standardization etc.) of heritage data (among others through so-called ‘data 
workshops’ in several provinces) which are continued in the next few years.  
Under the guidance of the Steering Committee for Culture, Heritage, and Landscape (CDCPP) of the Council of Europe 
a working group is  preparing policy guidelines on the latest technological developments such as AI.  
Media policy and AI 
In November 2023, the Steering Committee on Media and Information Society (CDMSI) of the Council of Europe 
adopted Guidelines on the responsible implementation of AI in journalism.119 Until the end 2025, an expert group is 
working under guidance of the CDMSI on the topic of the impact of generative artificial intelligence for freedom of 
expression.  
Spatial computing, AI and blockchain are converging, and this meeting of tech is unlocking new possibilities by 
redefining our interaction with the digital and physical worlds.120 Spatial computing, which encompasses augmented 
reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR), allows people to transcend traditional mediated interactions and 
engage with a dynamic three-dimensional world. In response to these developments, the European Commission has 
recently set out a vision and strategy on “virtual worlds” (which include metaverses), based on respect for digital rights 
and European laws and values.121 At the request of the Dutch government the Rathenau institute produced a report 
on immersive technology.122 A Creative Industries Immersive Impact Coalition (CIIIC)123 has been launched to enable 
creative industries and content creators to capitalize on opportunities around immersive experiences. In order to steer

SCIENTIFIC AND EDUCATIONAL 
RESEARCH AN D INNOVATION  
RESEARCH AND INNOVATION  
This section will examine the scientific and educational dimensions. Since these components play a vital role in 
advancing AI, assessing them provides valuable insight into a country’s AI readiness. The scientific dimension is 
evaluated through the nation’s research and innovation (R&I) performance, which includes metrics like R&D spending, 
research output, ethical AI research, and innovation in AI talent. On the other hand, the educational dimension is 
measured by factors such as educational strategies, infrastructure, curriculum quality, attainment levels, and public 
accessibility to AI education. 
The impact of AI on science and research and related policies has become relatively recently a topic of international 
policy interest124. Within UNESCO, the opportunities and challenges at the intersection of open science and AI have 
recently been debated.125  
The European Commission and its Member States including the Netherlands have become active in studying the 
impact of AI on research and innovation and developing a policy agenda in this area.126 For developing a policy on AI 
in Science the European Commission has two key directions in mind. Firstly, accelerating the adoption of AI by 
scientists, by creating essential enablers such as improved access to data, computational power, and talent. Secondly, 
monitoring and steering the impact of AI on the scientific process, addressing science-specific AI challenges such as 
preserving scientific integrity and methodological rigour.127 In June 2023 the European Commission published a R&I 
literature study on the impact of AI on research and innovation.128 It also published recommendations how to 
accelerate the responsible uptake of AI in science129 – most notably by providing academics greater access to 
computing power and data to lead innovations. For the Netherlands, this is also an important objective.  
A framework for cooperation and mutual learning between EU Member States in science and innovation is a step 
towards realising a European Research Area (ERA). In the context of the ERA policy agenda 2025-2027, the European 
Commission, EU Member States and stakeholders have jointly developed in March 2024 a set of guidelines to support 
the European research community in their responsible use of generative AI.130 These living guidelines provide simple 
and actionable recommendations to the research community on their use of generative AI, targeted to three main 
research actors: researchers, research organisations and research funding organisations. The Netherlands has actively 
contributed to these guidelines, represented by the Dutch research funding organisation NWO. The Dutch Research 
Council (NWO) has recently set itself guidelines regarding the use of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) for

applicants, reviewers and NWO employees. Applicants are allowed to use GAI, but its use is prohibited for reviewers 
and NWO employees involved in the application review process131. 
While the EU’s AI Act has only a limited impact on science – the law contains exceptions for research – it will establish 
technical standards, ethical requirements that must be followed, and more extensive documentation and transparency 
regulations. These will also hold researchers accountable and promote more responsible and ethical AI development. 
Funding of research and innovation 
While Dutch R&D is carried out by various types of organisations and financed from various sources. In 2022, € 22 
billion were available for research. The business community is both the largest financier and the largest executor of 
scientific research. In addition to the business community, the government is an important source of funding and 
Dutch researchers receive money from abroad (e.g. Horizon Europe) and other parties, such as private non-profit 
organisations. Researchers carry out their research within companies, higher education institutions and other research 
institutions, such as the NWO institutes or the RIVM. 
The central government finances almost a third of Dutch R&D. Government funding of scientific research takes place 
in numerous ways:  
• 
Direct government funding: This includes fixed contributions to institutions (so-called institutional funding or 
basic funding). The largest part of this fixed contribution goes to universities. In addition, there are fixed 
contributions for universities of applied sciences, research institutes and knowledge institutions affiliated with 
the central government. 
• 
Financing research via intermediary organisations, such as the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific 
Research (NWO: instruments), the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW) and the 
Netherlands Enterprise Agency (RVO: subsidies & funding). Researchers can apply for funding from these 
organisations for their projects within various research programmes.  
• 
Fiscal support: In addition to direct financing for R&D, there is indirect, fiscal support for R&D and innovation. 
This fiscal support makes it more attractive for companies to invest in R&D and innovation, for example 
through tax deductions.  
In the European context, the Netherlands benefits and actively engages with programs and organizations for the 
funding of research and innovation. Horizon Europe, the European Union’s main research and innovation funding 
programme supports technological and societal aspects of AI development and deployment, with specific calls in this 
area is increasing. Additionally, the European Research Council (ERC) grants support to investigation-driven frontier 
research across all fields based on scientific excellence, including top leading AI research. To keep pace with trends 
and developments in the United States and Asia, European governments and firms should together spend 3% of GDP 
annually on R&D (Europe 2020 strategy objective). The EU objective of 3% was first mentioned in 2000, in the Lisbon 
Treaty. A decade later, the EU drafted the Europe 2020 strategy. Based on the international average, the expectation 
is that a third of this investment should come from the public sector and two thirds from industry.  
According to the OECD, the Netherlands has a gross expenditure in research and development (GERD) of 2.3% of the 
national GDP in 2021, which places it in the 10-20 range worldwide.132 Eurostat calculated that in 2022, 0.82% of all 
government budget allocations were directed at R&D, which is slightly higher than the EU average of 0.73%.133

Figure 0.1 shows that total research and development (R&D) expenditure has risen sharply since the start of the century134. By 2021, 
it stood at 19.5 billion euros. Generally, industry accounts for the largest share of total investments in R&D.

The figure above shows that the R&D intensity over the entire period falls within a bandwidth of 1.64% to 2.32% of 
GDP, with a few higher and lower outliers. The total R&D investments can for some years be divided in the part invested 
by the Dutch government, by the private sector, by private non-profit organizations and foreign investments. Foreign

investment in R&D are provided by foreign firms and, in the public sector, the European Union. The overall figure for 
2021 is 2.26% of GDP and 2.27% for 2022 (details not available). The Netherlands' public spending on R&D is more or 
less in the middle: close to the EU-15 average (the 15 EU Member States in 1995) and slightly above the OECD average 
(the partnership of 36 economies). 
The role of higher education in scientific research 
Research universities in the Netherlands are instrumental in advancing knowledge, driving innovation, and supporting 
the country’s economic and social development. Renowned for their research excellence, institutions such as Delft 
University of Technology, University of Amsterdam, and Leiden University contribute significantly to various fields, 
including technology, life sciences, and humanities. Table 0.1 presents the top research universities in the Netherlands, 
accordingly to the Times Higher Education Ranking. The Netherlands is one of the few countries of which all universities 
are placed in all international rankings.

Research universities foster close collaborations with industry partners, translating academic research into practical 
applications that spur technological advancements and economic growth. By providing the next generation of 
scientists and engineers and a skilled workforce at large, and engaging in international research networks, they play a 
crucial role in maintaining the Netherlands' position as a global leader in high-tech industries. Beyond scientific and 
economic contributions, Dutch research universities address societal challenges through interdisciplinary research, 
impacting public health, climate change, and social issues. 
According to OECD data, the Netherlands ranks around place 10 among EU countries in regard to the amount of AI 
publications per capita. In 2023, this amounted to 2855 publications on AI, out of a total of 68513 publications.135

The 36 Universities of Applied Science in the Netherlands contribute also to the production and distribution new 
knowledge of AI applications and their impact, and innovation as a result. As indicated before, together with the 
Taskforce for Applied Research, government started a collaborative partnership to explore ways in which IT/AI-
lectorates can help local government bodies to develop, use and scale-up AI.  
 
 
EDUCATION  
EDUCATION 
 
The Netherlands ranks fourth in the Global Skills Report 2024 by Coursera.136 Based on Eurostat data from 2021, there 
were 15.4 STEM graduates per 1000 inhabitants, which is below the EU average of 23.0.137 The percentage of ICT 
graduates in 2021 was 3.7%, which is also slightly below the EU average (4.2%), according to Eurostat.138  
In 2024, the Netherlands has 32 tertiary education programmes dedicated to AI, machine learning or data science.139 
When extending this to tertiary education programmes that offer one or more module in AI, machine learning or data 
science, this number rises to 49.140 There are also eight programmes which offer modules in digital anthropology, 
philosophy of technology, ethics of AI or related/similar disciplines.  
In all levels of education, there are programmes that include both technical and ethical aspects of AI. In primary 
education, programming lessons are available.141 An example of a specific AI project for young learners was the 
Generation AI program of the University of Groningen, which helped them understanding the basic principles of AI.142 
Several universities (of Applied Sciences) offer data science and AI education programmes with responsible AI and 
ethical components.143  
In the Netherlands, the independence of educational institutions is a constitutional right. The Dutch government does 
not publicly own, provide, or directly subsidize digital tools for school management (e.g. student admission system, 
learning management system). Private companies have numerous opportunities to provide schools with digital tools 
and resources, and public-private partnerships in the educator sector are common. A number of public/cooperative 
organizations support individual education institutions with knowledge, expertise, basic ICT infrastructure and 
opportunities for joint procurement.144 
Digital or AI literacy is currently not yet part of the mandatory curriculum for primary and secondary education in the 
Netherlands. A curriculum reform, which will develop learning objectives on digital literacy, relating also to AI, is 
expected to be implemented in the summer of 2025. Specifically for AI, students are to learn about how AI-systems 
functions and where the data comes from (primary education), and to explore the opportunities and limitations/risks 
of using AI (secondary education).145 
With the National Growth Fund (see also 1.5.3.1), the Dutch government allocates funding to multiple projects to 
stimulate and manage the digital transition of the educational sector. Several of these focus on various aspects of 
digitalization, like digital infrastructure, the use of new technologies in the classroom, or the ecosystem for digital

learning resources. Furthermore, the scope of the projects have a different range, with various sectors and stakeholders 
involved per project. There are several projects that received funding to develop and manage elements of the digital 
transition of the educational sector:  
• 
In the National Education Lab AI (NOLAI) teachers, academics and businesses work together to improve the 
quality of primary and secondary education using smart technology.146 Also, NOLAI researches the 
opportunities and risks of new AI-technologies for education and examines the pedagogical, societal, and 
social implications of the use of these new smart technologies in the classroom. 
• 
For vocational training schools, universities of applied sciences and research universities, Npuls works on a 
future-proof education sector which gives an impetus to innovation and uses the opportunities offered by 
digitalization.147 The goal of Npuls is to work towards a sector providing high-quality education continuously 
keeping itself updated and relevant. Npuls invests in the development of a knowledge and technology 
infrastructure for higher education and vocational training, the establishment of Centers for Teaching and 
Learning at every institution and the arrangement of transformation hubs such as Data & AI, XR and open 
education. 
Some issues in Dutch digital education, notably the protection of data and privacy, are governed by binding rules set 
at the EU level. While the government monitors and evaluates the adherence of schools to these regulations, schools 
themselves are responsible for ensuring data privacy protection. Regarding more advanced technologies, such as AI-
powered tools, the EU AI Act aims to tackle their increasing use in education. The Netherlands is represented in the 
EU working group on digital education (DELTA) under the umbrella of the European Education Area. One of the 
guiding policies for the working group is the Digital Education Action Plan 2021-2027, which has actions on AI, as well 
as the guidelines for the use of AI and data in education, which will be updated in 2025. In the working group, 
policymakers of all Member States discuss actions that could be implemented at the EU level to support education 
institutions and professionals in how to use AI in a responsible and effective manner.  
Digital skills strategy 
With 83% of the Dutch adult population having at least basic digital skills in 2023, the Netherlands is the EU front 
runner on basic digital skills. The main programme to improve basic skills for adults has been for many years Count 
on Skills (Tel Mee met Taal, 2021-2024). Through this programme, municipalities received funding to offer courses and 
training in basic skills (reading, writing, arithmetic, and digital skills) in libraries and community centres, and via 
employers.  The Ministry of Education, Culture and Science will continue to work towards improving basic skills of 
adults after the end of this programme. The Netherlands also supports initiatives that focus on improving access to 
digital devices and internet for people with limited means, in-person support for people that need help with digital 
government services, as well as initiatives that improve knowledge and understanding of the impact of new 
technologies. 
In 2018, the online ‘Nationale AI Cursus’ was launched for the general public, which was aimed at increasing AI 
awareness.148 The course ‘Ethiek en AI’ was followed by a course focused on AI & ethics.149 In addition, courses related 
to AI and specific sectors (such as education and healthcare) were also developed.

ECONOMIC 
LABOUR MARKETS 
 
This section will explore the economic dimension of AI. This aspect examines factors within the ecosystem where AI 
systems are created and utilized, including impacts on the labour market, intermediate consumption, investment, and 
production related to AI. Key considerations include the labour market's dynamism and skill levels, as well as spending 
on intermediate goods, investments, and production. These elements are vital for assessing the readiness and 
performance of the ecosystems where AI operates. 
In 2022 the Netherlands published the Digital Economy Strategy.150 This strategy contained the elaboration of the 
digital economy component from the broader digitalisation policy of the Dutch government and focussed on digital 
open strategic autonomy, well-functioning digital markets and services and digital infrastructure. Its objective is to work 
on a resilient, enterprising, innovative and sustainable digital economy, in which everyone in the Netherlands can 
participate. The strategy was developed around five priority themes (pillars). AI is expected to play a role in each of 
these pillars.  
1. 
Accelerating digitalization of SMEs 
2. Stimulating digital innovation and skills 
3. Creating the right preconditions for well-functioning digital markets and services  
4. Maintaining and strengthening a safe, reliable and high-quality digital infrastructure 
5. Strengthening cybersecurity 
With a total population close to 18 million inhabitants, of whom 13 are aged between 15 and 75, the net employment 
rate was at 73% (2022). In the Netherlands it is common for young people to already take on jobs while studying, and 
for older people to work past average retirement age. Consequently, the Netherlands’ has largely enjoyed a robust 
economy.  
However, ongoing trends – such as an aging population, declining quality in education, and increasing prevalence of 
mental and physical health issues151 – are putting pressure on the labour market and the economy. In fact, it was 
projected that if not addressed, these pressures on the labour market “could hamper the country’s ability to reach its 
social and economic goals”.152 
The International Monetary Fund recently published a report on the labour market in the Netherlands. Key points in 
relation to AI are summarised in Table 0.1.

Table 0.1: Key takeaways from the Selected Issues Report by the International Monetary Fund (2024).  
# 
Takeaway 
1 
The Dutch labor market is strong, with record-high labor participation 
2 
Amid high employment, the unemployment rate is at the lowest level in recent history 
3 
The labour market has become increasingly tight, with job vacancies at record levels. 
4 
Cyclical factors of robust post-pandemic recovery further exacerbated the already tight labour market. 
5 / 6  After the COVID-19 pandemic, labour shortages have become widespread across regions, sectors, and 
pay scales. [Moreover], the imbalance between labour demand and supply has continued to widen, 
with further reduction in unemployment requiring larger increases in job vacancies. 
21 
Skill mismatches create bottlenecks and exacerbate labour shortages in sectors relevant to greater 
digitalization and low-carbon transition.  
23 
Labor and skill shortages weigh on growth prospects, green transition, and digitalization. 
34 
Sectors requiring advanced skills, such as ICT, also experience labour shortages, primarily driven by 
insufficient matching of skills supply and demand and foresight deficiency. 
The shortages in the labour market for ICT were also observed in the government’s central bureau of statistics (CBS)’s 
The Netherlands in Numbers 2024 and by the governments’ employee insurance agency UWV.153 A recent study by an 
interdisciplinary group of researchers concluded that with Dutch “SMEs and large organisations […] increasing demand 
in the market for support with digitisation”, the “market demand mainly requires senior [ICT] staff which is difficult to 
recruit and retain in the current tight labour market”.154 
Notwithstanding, the IMF report concludes that “the Netherlands, already a European digital frontrunner, is well-
positioned to leverage digitalization to help address labour shortages and boost productivity”.155 It suggests to enhance 
the appeal of specific sectors (such as health, education, and hospitality), to enhance the appeal of living and working 
in specific regions, and to turn towards active migration policies (return of own nationals, managed migration, 
integration of refugees).  
In response to these trends, the Netherlands recognises its potential and is committed to take action. As disclosed in 
its National Digital Decade strategic roadmap of 2024),156 the Netherlands is committed to meet the goals set by the 
European Commission. 
Labour market statistics 
According to the AI Index Report 2024 by Stanford, the percentage of job postings requiring AI-related skills in The 
Netherlands amounted to 1.12%, which is below the United States and Sweden, but above countries such as the UK, 
Germany and Italy.157

Based on the data, relative AI skill penetration and AI talent concentration amount to 1.13% and 0.61% respectively. 
Skill penetration refers to the prevalence of AI skills across occupation; talent concentration means the portion of 
LinkedIn members that are considered AI talent (explicit mention of AI skills in profile).158  
Figure 0.1 displays the LinkedIn AI hiring rate index (HRI).159 The graph shows steady growth over time as more and 
more people are hired in the strategic sector that is AI. This is also reflected in the Artificial Intelligence Index Report 
2024, where the relative AI hiring rate year-over-year ratio stands at around 5% (Stanford University, 2024).

INVESTMENTS AN D OUTPUT 
INVESTMENTS AND OUTPUT  
Information and communication technologies play a vital role in the Netherlands’ economy, one which is heavily 
service-oriented, with around two thirds of GDP coming from it.161 The Netherlands has long been a globally focused 
economy, and its strong digital infrastructure and international business environment make it a key hub for financial 
services. As the Netherlands allocates a total budget (excluding private investments) estimated at EUR 4.9 billion (0.5% 
of GDP) to the digital transformation, it comes to no surprise that the Netherlands is well on track to meet the European 
Union’s Digital Decade targets by 2030.162 
Although manufacturing represents a minor share of the workforce, it remains highly competitive and export-oriented, 
often relying on innovative technological solutions to maintain efficiency and global reach. The sharp rise of ASML – 
the now largest supplier for the semiconductor industry and sole supplier of lithography machines that are able to 
produce the most advanced chips – is a success story “made in the Netherlands” that was the fruit of years of careful 
investments and tedious research.163 
Public Investment 
According to an annex of the Strategic Action Plan for AI, the annual government budget for AI research and 
innovation in that year was estimated at EUR 45 million. In 2019, this budget was EUR 64 million. In 2020, the 
Netherlands allocated an additional EUR 23.5 million to the Dutch AI Coalition. Furthermore, in April 2021, an 
investment program was approved, aiming to enhance AI's potential for the Dutch economy and society, with up to

EUR 276 million to be invested over the coming years with the Dutch National Growth Fund.164 The public investments 
made by the Netherlands span various sectors and are distributed over numerous initiatives.  
 
Private Investment 
Worldwide, private investments into AI have increased by 18x from 2013 to 2018.165 In the Netherlands, venture capital 
investments have seen growth (Figure 1.9). The Netherlands counts over 25+ unicorns - most of which are active in 
the financial sector. According to an estimation by Dealroom, three industries (finance, health, food) accounted for 
around $1 billion, or more than half of all venture capital investments.166 Over 75% of investment go into ventures 
located in hubs of the provinces of North Holland, South Holland, and North Brabant.

National Growth Fund 
Through the National Growth Fund (NGF), the government invests in projects that would lead to long-term 
economic growth. The National Growth Fund does this together with initiators and other investors. With the NGF, 
the cabinet is investing over €11 billion in 50 projects that contribute to the sustainable earning capacity of the 
Netherlands. As of 2024, the NGF will cease funding new projects, but will continue the projects that are currently 
ongoing. This will continue for another 4-8 years, which means that ongoing projects will be able to deliver their 
outcomes.  
A selection of ongoing projects shows that there is a high level of engagement with sectors related to AI:  
• 
National AI Lab for Education (NOLAI): researches and facilitates the development of digital tools for 
primary and secondary education.  
• 
Npuls: researches and facilitates the development of digital education content and preconditions for 
effective use of digital tools in higher education and VET.  
• 
Creative Industries Immersive Impact Coalition (CIIIC): stimulates the development of knowledge and 
methods for the application of immersive experiences (IX) via the creative and cultural sector.  
• 
AINed: public-private partnership to develop a strong national AI-ecosystem for innovation, education 
and (small) business.  
These projects are important for organizations in different sectors to develop and experiment with the 
implementation of AI, so that the eventual use of AI will be done in the most effective and responsible manner.

Figure 0.9: Venture capital investment by stage, retrieved from Dealroom. 
For venture capital investments in AI specifically, one can observe steady growth (Figure 1.10). In spite of that growth, 
the Netherlands is lagging behind in terms of private investments into AI relative to other developed economies such 
as the United States, South Korea, or China.167 Likely, this is to be explained by a more conservative attitude towards 
high-risk investing. Indeed, according to Tjark Tjin-A-Tsoi, CEO at TNO, “‘in the Netherlands, we traditionally invest 
substantially in academic and fundamental research, but that is only the beginning of the innovation chain. There is a 
significant gap between research and the creation of companies […]. This gap is often referred to as the ‘Valley of 
Death’ - many promising technologies fail due to a lack of funding. Venture capital plays a role here. But the 
Netherlands, like much of Europe, is severely undercapitalized in venture capital compared to the United States. The 
largest proportion of capital in the Netherlands is locked in risk-averse pension funds”.168  The Techleap's 'State of 
Dutch Tech' report recently confirmed that there is still much to be gained. Especially considering the decrease of new 
startups and the lack of Dutch investors in large financing rounds169. 
 
167 This especially holds for the case of generative AI startups: https://epthinktank.eu/2024/04/04/ai-investment-eu-and-global-indicators/.

Public-Private Investment 
The Netherlands is unique in its form of public-private collaboration around the topic of AI. The most impactful 
collaboration was the Dutch AI Coalition (Nederlandse AI Coalitie, NL AIC).170 The NL AIC was the driving force behind 
the ELSA labs network (Ethical, Legal, Societal AI) by publishing a paper on the network in 2021.171 Different ELSA labs 
focus on different domains or specific applications, working in public-private and civic partnerships. In 2022, this lead 
to a first round of financing for five ELSA labs.172 In 2024, a new round of funding for ELSA labs was announced by a 
cooperation of NWO and AiNed.173 At the beginning of 2025, the NLAIC and AiNed merged into the new public-

Collaborations across  national borders are encouraged by strengthening Netherlands’ partnership in European AI 
consortia (e.g. EU Horizon Europe programme174 for research and innovation) and participation in global partnerships 
(e.g. UNESCO’s IRCAI175).  
Through the Dutch AI Coalition, the public-private partnership investment program AiNed emerged in 2023. The 
national government invested €204.5 million in AiNED via the National Growth Fund, aiming to boost knowledge, 
innovation, and talent for AI in the Netherlands in the coming years. 14 PhD students have been awarded funding 
during 2022/23. These are both fundamental and multidisciplinary.176 Currently, AiNED is also working on the 
instalment of various AI innovation labs, incorporating opportunities for generative AI. This will likely include AI for 
healthcare, energy, manufacturing, and mobility. 
Beyond the Coalition, the long-term ROBUST program commenced at the University of Amsterdam in early 2023. The 
program aims to use AI to provide sustainable solutions to societally relevant issues. ROBUST is a consortium of 21 
knowledge institutions, 23 industrial partners and 10 social organizations in 17 public-private labs in the Netherlands. 
Of the 87.3 million euros, NWO will award 25 million euros.177 The program funds a total of 170 PhD student in two 
cohorts (85 in the first five years, 85 in the last 5 years of the 10 year-program which started in 2020). 
Recently, €13.5 million from the Ministry of Economic Affairs has been allocated for the development of GPT-NL by 
SURF, a Dutch language model for public purposes.178 In 2024, an open and transparent Dutch language model will 
be developed to reduce dependence on large tech companies. In 2025 and beyond, initial applications can be 
developed using the computing power of the national supercomputer (Snellius) of SURF (the organization responsible 
for ICT infrastructure for research and education). 
European dimension 
To stimulate European language models, the Netherlands has recently become a member of the Alliance for Language 
Technologies - European Digital Infrastructure Consortium (ALT-EDIC).179 AiNed is the mandated party, with TNO's 
support. The goal of ALT-EDIC is to establish a common European infrastructure in language technologies. Thus, the 
Netherlands hopes to build upon the results of the national GPT-NL through European cooperation. 
The Netherlands welcomes the AI Innovation package that was launched by the European Commission in January 
2024.180 Especially the proposal to establish AI factories is a major step to improve Europe's competitiveness and

Ethical, Legal and Societal Aspects (ELSA) Labs 
Through the Dutch AI Coalition (NL-AIC), government, industry, educational 
and research institutions and civil society organizations are working together on socially responsible AI applications. 
Among others, through labs in which scientists, entrepreneurs, and public institutions - the so-called ELSA labs – 
research the ethical, legal, and social aspects of AI. What the ELSA concept entails, the challenges involved and the 
way for all parties in the quadruple helix (government, industry, science and residents of the Netherlands) to tackle 
it are described in the manifesto entitled Human-Centric Artificial Intelligence: A call for sensible and responsible 
applications.

technological leadership on generative AI. The Netherlands is currently exploring the need to set up such an AI factory 
which would provide access to (AI) supercomputing, data storage and a centre of expertise, knowledge and tools.

TECHNICAL AND INFRASTRUCTURAL 
INFRASTRUCTURE AN D CONNECTIVITY 
INFRASTRUCTURE AND CONNECTIVITY  
This section will address the infrastructural and technical dimensions of AI. These dimensions pertain to a country's 
capacity for developing and deploying AI solutions, including computing power, data centre availability, connectivity, 
and internet access. Such elements are critical enablers for AI development, as they shape a country's ability to process 
information and support the necessary infrastructure for AI systems. 
The Netherlands excels in digital connectivity, with widespread high-speed internet access and a robust 
telecommunications infrastructure, making it a leader in technology adoption and innovation. The country boasts one 
of the highest internet penetration rates in the world, with nearly universal access to broadband services. This extensive 
connectivity supports a thriving digital economy, where businesses and individuals alike benefit from seamless online 
interactions and transactions. 
 
Figure 0.11: Infrastructure and access (per 100 inhabitants, 2022).181 
Based on ITU data from 2022, the Netherlands has 118 mobile telephone subscriptions per 100 inhabitants, as well as 
123 active mobile broadband subscriptions. Fixed broadband telephone subscriptions have decreased, now at 44 
subscriptions per 100 inhabitants.182 The average international bandwidth is reported at 118 per user, with an average 
fixed broadband download speed of 142 Mbit/s.183 99% of the country is covered by at least a 3G mobile network.184 
The gender gaps in internet access and mobile access are low, at 4.1% and 2.1% respectively.185 According to OECD 
data, the difference between urban and rural access is also minimal at 1.14%.186  
Infrastructure 
Deep-sea cables 
To facilitate global connectivity, a crucial component of network infrastructure is deep-sea (submarine) internet cables. 
In the past, ownership of submarine cables was primarily with telecommunications companies which would form

consortia to share access. However, as the internet expanded in the mid-to-late 1990s, more businesses recognized 
the value of investing in this infrastructure, helping the global internet to flourish. Governments and industries 
worldwide also began to view submarine cables as critical infrastructure.187 
In recent years, major technology companies such as Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Alphabet have become significant 
investors in new cables. Before 2012, these companies accounted for less than 10% of submarine cable usage, but this 
figure has since surged to over 66%.188 Against this backdrop, concerns have been growing regarding the potential 
vulnerabilities of these critical infrastructures and their risks to digital sovereignty.189 Traditionally, the Netherlands has 
been an important digital hub in Europe. The sea cables come ashore in the Netherlands and turned Amsterdam into 
a digital hub. That had a huge appeal to parties that need a strong digital network, such as education and research. 
The leading position that the Netherlands has had for a long time is now under pressure, as observed for example by 
SURF and the Dutch Sea Cable coalition.190 
Data centres 
Data centres in the Netherlands are a critical component of the country's digital infrastructure, contributing significantly 
to its status as a global technology hub. Strategically located within Europe, the Netherlands offers excellent 
connectivity to major markets, supported by a robust and extensive fibre-optic network. The country is home to 
numerous data centres, including hyperscale facilities operated by leading tech companies such as Microsoft, Google, 
and Amazon. The Amsterdam Internet Exchange (AMS-IX),191 one of the world's largest data transport hubs, further 
enhances the Netherlands’ appeal for data centre operations. Additionally, the Dutch government and private sector 
are committed to sustainable practices, with many data centres utilizing green energy sources and innovative cooling 
technologies to minimize environmental impact.  
The Netherlands is home to 81 data centres. They are located across the country (Table 1.11) with the province of Noord 
Holland having most of these.192 This can partly be explained by the concentration of multinational corporations around 
the economic region of Amsterdam and the broader ‘Randstad’ region of Rotterdam and The Hague.

High-performance computers 
High-performance computing (HPC) in the Netherlands plays a vital role in advancing scientific research, innovation, 
and technological development. The country boasts state-of-the-art HPC facilities that support a wide range of 
applications, with Snellius as the national supercomputer managed by SURF, the collaborative organization for ICT in 
Dutch education and research. These supercomputers provide researchers with the computational power needed to 
tackle complex problems and perform simulations that were previously impossible.

Custom research workloads, flexible HPC use 
The Dutch government's investment in HPC infrastructure, coupled with strong collaborations between universities, 
research institutions, and industry, ensures that the Netherlands remains at the forefront of computational science.  
However, the Netherlands currently does not have a supercomputer powerful enough for generative AI. Dutch 
researchers' need for computational capacity is growing faster than the available capacity in our country. This is shown 
in the recent report Computational Needs for Accelerated Scientific Discovery193. Strengthening the AI ecosystem is 
also high on the European political agenda. On 24 January 2024, the European Commission launched the AI Innovation 
Package, which included the concept of an AI factory194. The aim is to make computing power, data and expertise 
accessible to start-ups and scientists. At the request of the Dutch parliament, the Dutch government described on 4 
June 2024 the possibilities for increasing access to an AI ecosystem for the Netherlands.195 One of the possibilities is to 
create an AI-facility in the Netherlands. Both the government and Parliament are in favour of this type of scenario.196 
This scenario will be further elaborated, concerning different aspects such as location, costs, business case and – on 
special request of Parliament – the impact on energy usage and environmental aspects.197

HARMONIZED STANDARDS 
 
The Royal Netherlands Standardisation Institute (NEN) is the official standards organisation in the Netherlands.198 
Founded to develop, maintain, and promote Dutch and international standards, NEN plays a crucial role in ensuring 
quality, safety, and efficiency across various fields and industries. The institute collaborates with businesses, government 
entities, and other stakeholders to develop national, European (CEN/CENELEC) and international (ISO/IEC) standards. 
On the topic of AI, NEN created a standards committee ‘Artificial Intelligence & Big Data’. This committee consists of 
Dutch stakeholders who are involved in AI and big data in various ways, from lawyers, ethicists and researchers to AI 
developers, data scientists, AI users and governments.199 Through this committee, its members can engage with the 
AI standardisation process at European (Joint Technical Committee 21 Artificial Intelligence) and international (Joint 
Technical Committee 1 Sub Committee 42) level. The level of participation can reach from attending meetings, to 
commenting and voting on draft standards, to actively contributing in the standards writing process as an expert.  
Within the CEN/CENELEC organisation, Joint Technical Committee 21 Artificial Intelligence (JTC 21) is tasked by the 
European Commission with the development of harmonised standards for the European Union AI Act. The NEN AI & 
Big Data committee contributes to the development of these standards and coordinates the Dutch comments and 
position regarding the content of these standards.

EVALUATION 
OVERVIEW OF  STAKEHOLDER EN GAGEMENT PROCESS  
In the first phase of writing the report, the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science and the Ministry of the Interior 
and Kingdom Relations reached out to a wide range of experts in the field of AI from academia, civil society and the 
business sector. Not everyone was available to take part in the Stakeholder group, but the group was considered 
representative. Two workshops were held where the stakeholders were asked for their input on the report. These 
workshops formed the basis for the recommendations in chapter 2. To provide an overview of the activities in the 
Netherlands, the Netherlands’ Stakeholder Team subsequently requested a formal evaluation of the Dutch AI 
Landscape. This evaluation was conducted by TNO. It is separated into a general evaluation and a dimension specific 
evaluation.  
 
MAIN CHALLEN GES IDENTIFIED THROUGH PREVIOUS CONSULTATIONS  
GENERAL EVALUATION 
 
The Netherlands performs well across all the dimensions of the RAM. This achievement is largely due to the country's 
well-established and dynamic research and innovation ecosystem around AI as government, private companies, and 
higher-education institutions collaborate effectively. All these factors are seen as contributing to the country’s readiness 
in adopting and implementing artificial intelligence in an ethical and trustworthy manner.203 
The Dutch government plays a pivotal role by investing in responsible technology research and innovation fostering 
interdisciplinary education, and supporting internationalization. It coordinates efforts through public-private 
partnerships, a multitude of programs and funding initiatives led by close to the entire roster of Ministries. As member 
state of the European Union, the Netherlands is firmly embedded within wide-reaching regulation on data privacy and 
AI.   
Industry in the Netherlands is instrumental for the ecosystem around AI. The industrial sector is known for its strong 
focus on research and development, with numerous multinationals engaging in partnerships with universities and 
research institutions to work at the cutting edge of technology. These collaborations enhance the practical application 
of research and thereby, ensure that strategic sectors remain competitive and autonomous.  
Educational institutions are another cornerstone of the Netherlands’ success. Dutch universities and research 
institutions are renowned for their excellence and interdisciplinary mindset. They do not operate in isolation but are 
deeply integrated into diverse, international ecosystems through partnerships with the government and industry, as 
well as foreign research institutions. This integration and collaboration ensure that the research conducted is relevant 
and that graduates are well-prepared for the demands of the modern workforce.  
Regulations and recommendations, on the international, European, and national level, provide clarity for the above to 
innovate and operate with AI. The Netherlands is well aligned with the UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of AI 
as it established a supervising authority. Moreover, it is firmly integrated with European regulation on AI with the AI 
 
203 The success of the Netherland’s in doing so is also reflected by the highest score achieved on the Global Index on Responsible AI (2024) 
by the Global Centre on AI Governance.

Act on data protection and privacy with the GDPR and on procurement. It formulated national legislation, from data 
sharing to the freedom of information and it implemented measures for public accountability. 
In summary, the Netherlands’ robust performance across all the dimensions can be attributed to the synergistic 
relationships developed over years of collaboration between government, industry, and educational institutions. 
Supported by firm regulations and the adherence to international recommendations, this tripartite creates a fertile 
ground for responsible innovation in and guided research on AI, ensuring that the country remains competitive and 
future-proof.

Artificial Intelligence Act  
Since 2019, the Netherlands invested considerable efforts into AI. It did so to capitalize on societal and economic 
opportunities all while creating the right conditions to be at the forefront of innovation and safeguarding public 
interests. To do so, the government published an Action Plan (2019), Values-Driven Digitalisation Work Agenda (2022), 
and eventual government-wide Vision (2024). Regulation of the European Union is firmly embedded within the Dutch 
policies and laws, not least with the General Data Protection Regulation and the Artificial Intelligence Act which just 
entered into force. Respectively, these regulations are the first to systematically tackle the protection of personal data 
and stimulate the development of safe and responsible AI. Both, among other regulations on data sharing, 
procurement, and freedom of information, have wide reaching effects on organizations developing and deploying 
digital technologies such as AI; ensuring high degrees of transparency, accountability, and responsibility.  
However, as pointed out by leading academics in the field, these two regulations are not without flaws.204 The 
Netherlands’ Stakeholder Team pointed out contention in the European Union’s AI Act; specifically, with regards to 
the exemptions that leave Member States with space to make their own policy decisions in the deployment of AI for 
national security, defence, and other specified domains. Additionally, the group flagged that one inherent flaw of the 
AI Act (as well as connecting national legislation) is that it only focuses on AI. The group advocated for regulation to 
prevent algorithmic harms more generally. At last, it was suggested that the role of regulatory sandboxes as introduced 
under the EU AI Act should be fully exploited as a relevant addition to the regulatory mix of the Netherlands.

The Netherlands has a leading role in promoting cultural diversity and inclusion. This holds within the field of AI and 
beyond by emphasizing human-centred policies that align with human rights and ethical innovation. Dutch policy 
actively integrates considerations of equality, emancipation, and non-discrimination into AI development and 
deployment, ensuring that technological advancements are inclusive and beneficial to all societal groups including 
those that are most marginalized. Through collaborative programs and initiatives between government, academia, 
civil society, and industry, the Netherlands attempts to promote and prioritize diversity and inclusion to set a global 
example for ethically driven AI practices. Furthermore, the Netherlands has grown considerably more active in the field 
of digital healthy policy. It implemented policy fostering digital well-being in education, establishing the rights of 
children online, among others.  
However, despite these efforts and activities, the stakeholder team flagged the overarching topic of civic engagement 
as weakly embedded in the Dutch AI policy. Issues of civic engagement are systemic, organizational issues205 that 
require a form of self-reflection (on topics such as: prejudice, discrimination, etc.). Doing so would allow the 
government to become a possible thought leader and role model in this area.

Government-wide vision on generative AI of the Netherlands 
The Netherlands is at the forefront of innovative research and innovation due to, and building on, several decades of 
investments. The funding mix has steadily increased and originates from several sources. Most funding comes from 
industry; second most, although decreasing overall, comes from the government. This latter can be direct funding, 
financing via intermediaries, or indirect fiscal support. Uniquely, the Netherlands fosters public-private partnerships 
around the topic of AI through the Dutch AI Coalition. This vehicle, among others, promotes interdisciplinary, ethical 
research and innovation of specific applications in the Netherlands and beyond. Primarily, the first beneficiaries of 
research and innovation funding are Dutch universities – organizations that are instrumental in advancing knowledge, 
driving innovation, and thereby supporting economic growth.  
However, as a consequence of announced budgetary cuts by the government, the Netherlands’ Stakeholder Team 
warned that these could negatively impact the Dutch level of education and the quality of academic research.

The Netherlands boasts a service based economy that thrives on public-private, public, and private investments into 
research and innovation. This holds in particular for AI. The economy leans on an education system that trains qualified 
graduates ready to enter this service based economy. In spite of their existence, the Dutch economy is facing structural 
tensions as a consequence of shortages.  
 
As the Netherlands’ Stakeholder team did not flag any particular recommendations of direct relevance to this 
dimension and in relation to AI, the recurring discussion around competitiveness and technological sovereignty are of 
importance for the autonomy of the country. On the European stage, one can refer to the report on competitiveness 
by Mario Draghi206 – which was well received in the Netherlands among others by the Council of Dutch Universities207 
and the Dutch Organisation for Applied Scientific Research.208 More recently, the discussion around technological 
sovereignty and the geo-political as well as socio-economic impact has entered the public discourse.209

However, the Netherlands’ Stakeholder Team advocated for further investments in both, data centres and high-
performance computers. These were seen as backbone to grow and advance the Dutch (digital) economy. Additionally, 
the group advocated for greater focus and research into the environmental footprint of Dutch AI applications.

RECOMMENDATIONS 
To formulate recommendations for the RAM, the Netherlands’ Stakeholder Team was brought together through 
several workshops that were led by TNO. The Stakeholder Team consisted of representatives from academia, civil 
society and the private sector (see Appendix B). Due to time constraints, the stakeholder group was of limited size but 
can still be considered representative because of their diverse background, expertise and different sectors that were 
represented. On the basis of the consultations, ten recommendations were formulated that would improve the 
implementation and/or use of AI in the Netherlands. Each recommendation is accompanied by a response from the 
Dutch government.  
 
LAWS AN D REGULATION  
LAWS AND REGULATION  
 
Clearly delineate how to address the use of AI under the exclusions of the AI Act and take a leadership 
position on the topic of human rights 
 
Under the AI Act, several sectoral exclusions are stipulated (defence and military, national security, scientific research 
and development). Some sectors come with specific provisions (law enforcement, public security, and open-source 
development). The exclusions are, for example, for national security, “justified both by the fact that national security 
remains the sole responsibility of Member States in accordance with Article 4(2) TEU and by the specific nature and 
operational needs of national security activities and specific national rules applicable to those activities” (AI Act, 2024, 
Article 24). It is worthy to note that the exclusion does not apply to dual-use technologies (i.e. those also used outside 
of the national security context) and that there is no clear definition of national security provided.  
 
The exclusions were debated extensively, both during the negotiation phase of the AI Act and by human rights 
groups.210 The Netherlands’ Stakeholder Team also highlighted caveats and potential weaknesses caused by the 
exclusions. Stakeholders mentioned the lack of clarity on the scope of national security, the potentially blurry lines 
between national and public security, and the high-stakes at hand which need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis 
to meet the requirements of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.211 
 
The stakeholders argued that the Netherlands must clearly delineate how to address the use of AI under the exclusions 
of the AI Act and take a leadership position on the topic of human rights.  
 
Government response 
The Dutch government acknowledges the exception in the European AI Act for among others national security, military 
or defence purposes. However, the Dutch government emphasises the need for the responsible and lawful use of AI.

This means that use of AI for national security, defence or military purposes should also comply with existing rules and 
legislation, and notes that dual use technologies fall within the scope of the AI Act.  
  
The Dutch Intelligence and Security Services Act 2017 (Wet op de inlichtingen- en veiligheidsdiensten (Wiv) 2017) 
governs the lawful use of automated data-analysis, which includes algorithms and AI, by the Dutch General Intelligence 
and Security Service (Algemene Inlichtingen en Veiligheidsdienst, AIVD). The Wiv 2017 contains an explicit legal 
prohibition on promoting or taking measures against a person solely on the basis of results of automated data analysis. 
In all cases, there will be a human assessment. Furthermore, the law states that the processing of personal data solely 
on the grounds of a person's religion or belief, race, trade union membership, health and sexual life is not permitted. 
The Oversight Committee for the Intelligence and Security Services (Commissie van Toezicht op de Inlichtingen- en 
Veiligheidsdiensten, CTIVD) (retroactively) monitors the compliancy of the AIVD with the Wiv 2017. This includes 
activities with the use of algorithms and AI. 
 
To address the issue of artificial intelligence in autonomous weapon systems, the Netherlands actively engages in the 
Group of Governmental Experts on Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems (GGE LAWS) of the United Nations Office 
for Disarmament Affairs (UNODA) as well as other pertinent international fora and conferences. During the period of 
2024–2026, the Dutch disarmament ambassador serves as Chair of the GGE LAWS. A central topic of discussion within 
the GGE LAWS is the application of international law, particularly international humanitarian law. The Netherlands often 
emphasizes the significance of international human rights law as a relevant legal framework for the potential 
development, deployment and use of weapon systems with autonomous capabilities and advocates for the inclusion 
of this topic in international discussions. Notably, the human rights legal framework imposes more stringent 
requirements on the use of deadly force in law enforcement contexts compared to the provisions of international 
humanitarian law governing combat operations. 
 
In 2023, the Netherlands’ government published a 2023-2027 strategy on data science and AI for defence.212 This 
Strategy prioritises investments in knowledge building in relation to ethical issues and meaningful human control, and 
aims to improve regulation and supervision on the use of algorithms within ethical and legal frameworks. In the context 
of AI for military purposes this is realised by adhering to NATO’s Principles of Responsible Use, as stipulated in the 
(revised) NATO AI Strategy213, the main principle in this context begin lawfulness (“AI applications will be developed 
and used in accordance with national and international law, including international humanitarian law and human rights 
law, as applicable”). 
 
In addition, to address the application of AI for defence and military purposes, the Netherlands has taken up an 
international leadership role by initiating the international discussion on responsible AI in the military domain. In 2023, 
the Netherlands hosted the Responsible AI in the Military domain (REAIM) Summit.214 As part of the summit’s outcomes, 
a Global Commission on Responsible AI in the Military Domain was launched by the Netherlands. In 2024, the 
Netherlands co-hosted the second REAIM Summit hosted by the Republic of Korea. The REAIM Blueprint for Action 
affirmed the importance of international human rights law for the development, deployment and use of AI in the 
military domain.215 
 
Following a joint Call to Action that government representatives issued at REAIM 2023 in the Netherlands, in 2024 the 
Netherlands and the Republic of Korea tabled the United Nations Resolution on AI in the military domain and its

implications for international peace and security, that was supported by a very large majority of States in the UN 
General Assembly.216 By endorsing this resolution States affirmed that international law, including the Charter of the 
United Nations, international humanitarian law and international human rights law, applies to matters governed by it 
that occur throughout the life cycle. The purpose of the UN resolution is to ensure that this issue is discussed more 
often and in greater detail by all the countries in the world. In the coming years, the Netherlands will continue to play 
a leading role in advancing the international debate on responsible application of AI in the military domain. 
 
 
Consider sovereignty on all layers of the technology stack in order to develop targeted efforts that 
increase competitiveness and reduce dependencies 
 
In spite of significant regulatory efforts and governance initiatives on AI, the Netherlands’ Stakeholder Group suggested 
that efforts should take into consideration all layers of the technology stack model (Figure 0.1) in order to have an 
overarching approach to digital open strategic autonomy.217 Digital sovereignty leads to agency in deciding the norms 
and values that AI tools should abide by. While the impact of AI is currently addressed on an infrastructural and 
technological level, more attention should go towards the application layer upon which digital platforms operate. In 
many different sectors such as education, digital platforms of Big Tech companies are pushing out smaller players in 
the national market, leading to dependencies and vendor lock-ins, privacy issues and market deterioration.  
 
 
Figure 0.1: (Simplified) technology stack model (adapted from Stolwijk et al., 2024). 
The ambiguity of regulating digital technologies has to do with their complexity and diversity. They involve multiple 
ingredients – data centres and graphic cards, networks and connectivity, data, and applications, and much more. In 
that context, it is worthwhile to consider complexity by means of a layered model.218 Once split into layers, it is possible

to identify dependencies and disentangle complexity from different perspectives.219 When focusing on (artificial) 
intelligence – one of the layers –, there are strong interlinkages to other layers such as chips, processing units, or cloud. 
 
The main conclusion to be drawn from this exercise for policy and regulation is that while national and European 
strategies to increase sovereignty and open autonomy show momentum, the scale in both ambition and financial 
terms is far below that of Chinese and American strategies. Hence, the recommendation of the Netherlands’ 
Stakeholder Team is first to consider sovereignty on all of the layers and second, to develop targeted regulatory efforts 
and policy initiatives that increase competitiveness and reduce dependencies. 
 
Government response 
Digital sovereignty is an important topic for the Dutch government. In 2023, the Agenda on Digital Open Strategic 
Autonomy (DOSA) was published.220 This agenda recognizes the increasing dependency on third countries for our 
digital technologies. The agenda has six stack levels: resources, hardware, physical infrastructure, soft infrastructure, 
data, and applications and services. On the basis of these stack levels, the agenda identifies several specific policy 
priorities: critical raw materials, quantum technology, photonics, semiconductors, network technology, open-source 
software, cloud, AI, cybersecurity, and office software. It also identifies more general priorities, such as competitiveness, 
effective policy and decision making, security policy, knowledge and skills, and international cooperation. With each 
priority, current and new (policy) initiatives are announced on the national and the EU level. In general, the Netherlands 
tries to keep digital sovereignty and open strategic autonomy on the EU-agenda, which is in line with the portfolio of 
the new EU Commissioner on Tech Sovereignty, Security and Democracy in 2024-2029, Ms. Henna Virkkunen.   
 
In the education sector, specific attention is directed at the implications of the EU Data Act and the Digital Services Act 
among others, on primary education and the digital applications used in it. The application of the General Data 
Protection Regulation (AVG) has already shown that EU regulation is an effective instrument to safeguard public values 
in education.221 The Dutch government has also recently mandated a study on alternatives for big tech platforms in 
education with a strong focus on public values such as privacy.222 The new Dutch Digitalisation Strategy (NDS) to be 
published in 2025 will continue to build on the work on safeguarding public values by the previous cabinet.223

Formulate programs and initiatives for civic engagement in policymaking on AI 
 
The Stakeholder Team flagged a general lack of civic engagement in AI policymaking. The core argument made is 
that policy developments often follows a top-down approach, where expert groups, industry representatives, and 
government bodies lead decision-making without substantial input from the broader public or civil society groups. 
Although initiatives such as the Dutch AI Coalition emphasize collaboration, they are often limited to those very 
stakeholders, rather than including a wide range of citizen perspectives.

Without mechanisms to make these processes more inclusive and accessible, such as public consultations, educational 
campaigns, or citizen assemblies on AI, there is a risk that AI policies will not adequately reflect the diverse concerns, 
values, and needs of Dutch society. This issue becomes of particular relevance in the case of AI being used for 
algorithmic-decision making.224 
 
In response, the Stakeholder Team advised to formally integrate civic engagement programs and initiatives in the 
policy-making process around AI.  
 
Government response 
The Dutch government acknowledges the need to encourage social dialogue and cooperation at various levels in 
order to be able to respond to the fundamental challenges that AI poses. Ensuring safe and responsible development, 
use, and integration of AI, as well as maximizing the opportunities that AI offers, requires a coordinated effort from all 
levels of government, the private sector, technical community, academia and civil society. Together with local 
governments and implementation organizations, the Netherlands is exploring ways in which AI can support in making 
communication with citizens clearer and more inclusive.  
 
The vision on generative AI has been developed in close collaboration with all levels of government (including 
organisations responsible for implementing policies), businesses from several domains and sectors, academia and civil 
society. This cooperation remains essential in the future as well. This means actively involving several actors such as 
civilians, policy-makers from all levels of government, employers, businesses, entrepreneurs, scientists, employees and 
educators. It is essential that various actors have a voice in shaping the future where generative AI plays a role.  
 
The Dutch AI Coalition played a crucial role in fostering social dialogue, for example through the AI-Parade. This was 
an initiative where 35 libraries were visited across the Netherlands, where citizens could engage in debates, workshops 
and exhibitions about AI.  
 
The aforementioned ELSA labs all focus on civic participation, aiming to establish a quadruple helix structure around 
their specific areas in which the private sector, academia, government and civic society explore AI-based solutions 
around specific societal challenges, for instance around security or agriculture.  
 
Additionally, the Dutch government aims to raise awareness about AI. For example, through the program Digitaal 
Burgerschap (Digital Citizenship) of the Dutch Royal Library, libraries offer events and educational opportunities for 
citizens to learn about topics such as AI.225 Likewise, the Dutch government launched an educational campaign about 
digitalisation including on AI.226 The campaign was a collaboration between the government and DPG-media in which 
400.000 citizens were reached.  
 
The DIGCOM monitor of the University of Amsterdam will measure, among other things, the knowledge and skills on 
AI of citizens on behalf of the Dutch government. Through this monitor the Dutch government aims to keep track of 
the current state of digital competences in the Netherlands. Alongside this monitor the Dutch government keeps track

of research and monitors that measure public sentiment and knowledge on AI, for example of the CBS227 and the 
Algosoc Monitor228 of the University of Amsterdam. 
 
Several government bodies such as the municipality of Amsterdam, initiated initiatives to engage civil society. For 
instance, to engage discussions amongst actors and collect feedback, the Dutch government organised dialogue 
sessions on AI systems-use in the public sector with civil society and public sector officials. 
 
In 2023, together with civic organizations, the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations also organized ethical 
dialogues amongst several actors from Dutch society on specific use-cases of generative AI, reflecting on both its 
opportunities and risks for society. At the end of 2023, the Rathenau Institute has published a report with an overview 
of opportunities, risks and ways to deal with generative AI, which it has presented to parliament.229  
 
Finally, in 2024, an online consultation was published, allowing actors (including academia, civic organisations, 
governmental bodies and citizens) to provide input on the matter of decisions made by administrative bodies, using 
algorithms or AI, as well as input on the potential implications for the Netherlands administrative law around increasing 
transparency and strengthening legal remedies for citizens when algorithms or AI are used in administrative decision 
making.230  
 
 
Build on the government-wide vision on generative AI of the Netherlands and define best-practices 
related to sustainability in AI development and use 
 
Even before the sudden surge of interest in generative AI, scientists had already flagged the considerable carbon 
footprint of AI. It is important to acknowledge that AI is destined to play a dual role. On the one hand, it can help to 
reduce the effects of the climate crisis – from optimising our energy grid to developing low-emission infrastructures. 
Yet, on the other hand, the carbon footprint of training AI models is considerable.231 Today, the “environmental impacts 
are expected to escalate considerably, with the global AI energy demand projected to exponentially increase to at 
least 10 times the current level and exceed the annual electricity consumption of a country like Belgium by 2026”.232 In 
addition to the high degree of carbon emissions and electricity use, AI is also associated with substantial water 
consumption, ‘both directly for onsite server cooling and indirectly for offsite electricity generation’.233 
 
In response, the Netherlands’ Stakeholder Team have recommended to define best-practices related to sustainability 
and environmental considerations in the development and use of AI (ideally, beyond the requirements stipulated in 
the AI Act). One basis to do so, would be to leverage and build on the government wide vision on generative AI (2024) 
where measures to reduce negative environmental impacts are advocated for. The vision advocates to focus on the 
integration of energy-efficient training processes and delivery, with priority given to the use of renewable energy 
sources.

It is also relevant to acknowledge the uneven distribution of AI’s environmental impacts. In its Recommendation on the 
Ethics of Artificial Intelligence (UNESCO, 2021), UNESCO has advised against the use of AI if it may lead to 
disproportionally negative impacts on the environment.234 Therefore, it was advised by the Netherlands’ Stakeholder 
Team to make conscious evaluations should further investments be made into, for example, data centres or high-
performance computers.  
 
Government response 
The Dutch government pays special attention to the impact of AI on sustainability and climate. The government 
recognises that (generative) AI can contribute to solving climate challenges, but so far it has only led to an increase in 
the ecological footprint. Therefore, the Netherlands believes it is essential to make these technologies more sustainable 
through more energy-efficient methods and promoting responsible and sustainable development and use. For the 
Dutch government, sustainability is a key principle in the deployment of AI, meaning that this technology will not be 
used if it causes significant harm to people and the planet. In 2024, Utrecht University was asked to conduct a study 
concerning the environmental impact of the use of generative AI by the public sector. Results of this study are expected 
in the beginning of 2025. 
 
More in general, the Dutch government is also committed to a sustainable digital infrastructure and the sustainability 
of other sectors through digitalisation. For this purpose, an Action Plan for Sustainable Digitalisation was drawn up in 
June 2024.235 The action plan contains 44 actions that relate to the sustainability of the digital infrastructure itself and 
the opportunities that digitalisation offers for sustainability in other sectors. The Dutch digitalisation sector itself has 
been taking important steps towards sustainability for some time now, as described in the State of the Digital 
Infrastructure.236 The Dutch government is working with sustainable frontrunners in the “National Coalition for 
Sustainable Digitalisation” to use their experiences more broadly for all entrepreneurs.  
 
Furthermore, the Energy and Sustainability working group of the NL AI Coalition will support the development of new 
AI solutions to challenges in the energy sector and around sustainability, and thus stimulate the Dutch economy.237 
Moreover, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has mandated Dialogic to research the energy- and water usage of AI. The 
goal is to analyse ways in which AI can be used in an energy-efficient manner. The study is expected to be published 
in May 2025.  
 
The Netherlands is also working with other EU Member States to exchange experiences around the dual transition of 
sustainability and digitalisation. A relevant fact is also that at EU level regulations in the field of circularity, recycling and 
reporting obligations for data centres are in place. The impact of these regulations will be monitored.  Beyond the EU, 
the Netherlands advocates for linking sustainability more closely with digitalization in the UN World Summit on the 
Information Society +20 review process.  
 
 
Explore the possibilities of establishing an advisory body of experts that monitors AI developments 
beyond the AI Act 
 
 
234 Beyond its exorbitant use of energy, AI is also associated with the consumption of large quantities of water (for server cooling and offsite 
electricity generation). In regions where there is already scarcity and the consequent risk for droughts are an important factor to consider 
(Hao, 2024).

The dynamic nature of technological development is at odds with the nature of policy making, regulation and 
enforcement. In particular, this holds for AI.238 The technology needs robust governance and institutions that are apt 
at fulfilling the AI Act. Academics have brought this topic to attention.239 
 
The Netherlands’ Stakeholder Team discussed the means to implement the Act by national and EU institutional bodies, 
and those established under the AI Act, such as the AI Office, and provided the recommendation of an additional 
structure – beyond those of the AI Act – by the establishment of an advisory body and expert group that continuously 
monitors developments in AI (including generative AI). That structure could provide guidance on technological 
developments as well as advise the government on the structural design of national bodies and the administrative 
capacities needed to enforce the AI Act.  
 
Government response 
Given the expected exponential growth that (generative) AI will undergo in the coming years, it is of significant 
importance for the Dutch government to closely monitor relevant developments. The Dutch government is, and will 
remain, in close contact with local governments, implementation organizations, knowledge institutions, commercial 
entities, public interest organizations, employers, employees, and citizens on this subject. Furthermore, the Netherlands 
will prioritize the implementation of the supervision and monitoring based on the AI Act. 
 
Secondly, at the request of the House of Representatives, the Dutch government also explored the establishment of 
an AI advisory body at the highest (Dutch) political level intensively. However, the installation of an AI advisory body 
advising the government is subject to stringent laws on such advisory bodies, requiring careful deliberation and formal 
procedures. Such bodies and the way they can and cannot operate may not fulfil the need expressed by parliament. 
Additionally, because of the consequences for the labour market, both in terms of employment and the quality of 
work, the government has asked its Social and Economic Council (Sociaal-Economische Raad, SER) to advise on the 
impact of AI on labour productivity, quantity, and quality of work. In other words, several institutes and advisory body 
are already in place when it comes to specific aspects of the implications of AI. 
 
Thirdly, AI is developing at such a rapid and disruptive pace that it is necessary to look for new ways to translate 
knowledge and research into effective policy and to connect researchers with policymakers and the parliament. The 
government has worked on and continues to work on ways to address this issue through the development of a ‘Science 
for policy’ approach. Policies developed solely on the basis of scientific knowledge are ‘evidence-based’; ‘evidence-
informed’ policy is developed when scientific knowledge is combined with practical knowledge.240 The ‘science for 
policy’ approach is an important tool to not only stay up-to-date on AI developments, but also to bridge the gap 
between policy and research in general. This is also supported by the EU platform ‘Knowledge4Policy’ which provides 
a high-quality research database that can be used by policymakers.241 The new European Commission has announced 
to strengthen the uptake of AI in research at European level, by setting up a European AI Research Council. At the 
level of the UN, the Netherlands plays an active role in defining the modalities of the Independent International 
Scientific Panel on AI to promote scientific understanding.

Prioritise in the expansion of assessments and labs for responsible development of AI and in the 
producing of new (general) tools 
 
The Netherlands’ Stakeholder Team flagged a discrepancy between the tools and assessments for the ethical / 
responsible / transparent development of AI and practice. Academics are well aware of the problematics with the 
panoply of existing guidelines, and the gap between ethics and practice. In a recent literature study, it was flagged 
that ethics in the context of AI guidelines is frequently not defined and rather vague, therefore making the application 
challenging at best, and contested at worst.242 Guidelines often lack agreement, both in terms of what the most 
important principles are and what their solutions are.243 As a result, one may observe a “gulf between ethical guidelines 
and practical implementation, a gap between principles and practice” that may maintain the status quo and an 
undesired outcome “business as usual”.244 
When turning to industry and business organisations, the symptoms are felt. Industry representatives within the 
Stakeholder Team flagged the need for more assistance in the implementation of the guidelines (and regulations). In 
response to these observations, it was recommended to prioritise the penetration of assessments and labs for 
responsible development of AI over the producing of new (general) tools.  
Government response 
Citizens and businesses must be able to trust that the government establishes appropriate frameworks and rules for 
(generative) AI. In this regard, attention should be paid to how existing and upcoming legislation is capable of 
encouraging the development and use of AI in a safe and fair manner. Clear national, European (or international) 
frameworks can contribute to accelerating innovation. The European AI Act provides a solid foundation in this respect. 
In the coming years, practical tools and guidelines are expected to be published by both the national government, 
supervisory authorities and the European Commission.  
To facilitate both private companies and government bodies with practical advice concerning compliance with the AI 
Act, the Netherlands is in the process of establishing regulatory sandboxes. With these sandboxes, supervisory 
authorities enter into a regulatory dialogue with participants to assist them with AI Act related questions on the 
development, testing or validation of (high risk) AI systems. Such measures will help increase legal certainty, thereby 
stimulating innovation, and increasing the development and use of responsible and safe AI.  
As for the public sector, in recent years, the Dutch government has provided policy aimed at the responsible 
development and use of algorithms and AI by government bodies, as well as fostering innovation of such technology. 
As mentioned in previous chapters, tools to help foster the responsible use of AI in the public sector include a 
fundamental rights and algorithms impact assessment for the early mapping of risks to fundamental rights in the use 
of algorithms and AI.  
To address the ‘panoply’ of guidelines and regulations, the Dutch government published an algorithm framework in 
2024.245 This framework provides an overview of applicable laws and regulations, provides practical tools and measures 
to take to comply with laws and regulations, as well as examples and use cases.  
Regarding the gap between ethical principles and practice, it should be mentioned that in the context of the UNESCO 
Recommendation on ethics an AI, not only an instrument for readiness assessment has been developped, but also an

instrument for Ethical Impact Assessment (EIA).246 The EIA is initially intended to help public sector officials involved in 
the procurement of AI systems, furnishing them with the set of questions to ask in order to ensure that the AI systems 
they are purchasing are aligned with the ethical standards set out in the Recommendation. However, it can also be 
used by developers or others in the private sector and elsewhere to facilitate the ethical design, development and 
deployment of an AI system. Further debate and research at international level how ‘to close the gap’ seems 
recommendable.  
 
CAPACITY BUILDING 
 
 
Invest in computing power, both in terms of data centres and high-performance computers 
 
Although the Netherlands has made considerable investments into its infrastructure and boasts elevated levels of 
connectivity, one can expect the need for further investments into computing power – both in terms of data centres 
and high-performance computers, but also in terms of undersea (submarine) internet cables. It is important to note 
that Big Tech has largely captured this market and, in the process, has taken control of critical infrastructure which may 
undermine the sovereignty of the Netherlands and Europe.247 
 
The advantage brought by bringing infrastructure to the Netherlands is that relative to other key inputs needed for AI 
(data and algorithms), the computing infrastructure is a particularly effective point of intervention. As was highlighted 
in a major report that sprung out of a collaboration between researchers from academia, civil society, and industry: 
“policymakers could use [computing infrastructures] to facilitate regulatory visibility of AI, allocate resources to promote 
beneficial outcomes, and enforce restrictions against irresponsible or malicious AI development and usage”.248 
 
However, one must acknowledge that with greater investments into infrastructure, the burden on the environment 
also increases. As was discussed previously (reference), investments need to account for the environmental impact of 
AI. In the Netherlands, municipalities where Big Tech companies are located have raised concerns over their interest 
in the region. The sentiment is shared that data centres are located strategically next to green energy wind parks to 
present users and investors with a sustainable and responsible image, even though these companies might be profiting 
unfairly from subsidised energy. This could lead to new inequalities as municipalities do not benefit from the green 
energy that is generated there locally.249 
 
In response to these developments and trends, the Stakeholder Team recommended to commit a greater amount of 
resources into computing power, both in terms of data centres and high-performance computers. 
 
Government response 
A government that wants to be in control should be a government that, within the existing legal frameworks, can 
experiment with safe and responsible (generative) AI to help academia, the private sector and public organisations 
discover where risks and opportunities lie in specific applications. Against this background, the former Dutch

government announced it was to investigate the establishment of a public national AI testing facility for responsible 
generative AI in the Netherlands.250 The programme of the current Dutch government states that the Dutch AI 
ecosystem will be strengthened by facilitating access for companies, researchers and governments to supercomputers, 
high-quality knowledge and data.251 This would create the preconditions for developing advanced AI and building 
knowledge, and ultimately to the earning and competitiveness of the Netherlands. 
 
Strengthening the AI ecosystem is also high on the European political agenda. On 24 January 2024, the European 
Commission launched the AI Innovation Package, which introduced the concept of an AI factory.252 The importance of 
investing in AI is also reflected in Mario Draghi's recently published report on the future of European competitiveness253, 
and the priorities of the new European Commission for the period 2024-2029.254 The Commission announced to 
ensure access to new, tailored supercomputing capacity for AI start-ups and industry through an “AI Factories initiative” 
in the first 100 days of its mandate. The European supercomputer innovation program 'European High Performance 
Computing Joint Undertaking' (EuroHPC JU) has organised a call for the co-financing of AI factories in Member States. 
The Dutch government is currently exploring the options for participation, also urged by members of parliament255, 
while taking into consideration the effects on the landscape and energy- and water usage.256 Additionally, the regional 
economic and social benefit is being explored. Depending on available funding from several sources the Dutch 
government, together with Dutch stakeholders, intends to submit a proposal for an AI facility in the Netherlands before 
the third assessment deadline, which closes in early May. 
 
 
Develop capacities to design policy that addresses digital and media literacy throughout all layers of 
society 
 
Digital literacy in marginalized communities remains a critical area for policy improvement, particularly in the age of 
AI, where divides can exacerbate existing inequalities.257 As AI-driven technologies become increasingly embedded in 
education, healthcare, and employment, those lacking basic digital skills are at a greater disadvantage.258 For 
marginalized groups, limited access to digital infrastructure and literacy means they miss out on opportunities to 
leverage tools that can enhance learning, job prospects, and access to services. Without targeted policies to improve 
digital literacy and ensure equitable access to AI technologies, these communities risk being left further behind in a 
rapidly evolving digital economy. Addressing this gap is essential for ensuring that AI benefits are distributed inclusively, 
empowering all sectors of society and creating a stronger societal support base for the digital economy. 
 
The Netherlands’ Stakeholder Team flagged that digital literacy in the context of marginalized communities remains a 
policy area for improvement.259 In response, the stakeholders recommended to develop capacities to design policy 
that addresses digital literacy throughout all layers of society. To do so, civic engagement and the participation of civil 
society in policy making was proposed as valuable method to follow.

Government response 
The increasing impact of AI on society has far reaching consequences. The pervasiveness of AI in day to day work, 
education and private life demands a basic level of skills that can help citizens assess the impact of the technology. 
Technological developments, such as the development of generative AI, increase the production and dissemination of 
disinformation. Distinguishing between reliable, objective and factual news and disinformation is becoming increasingly 
confusing. In addition, AI technology can facilitate microtargeting, posing risks both to privacy and personal autonomy. 
This necessitates further efforts to increase media literacy among various target groups in order to prevent less digitally 
adept people from falling behind as well as protecting them from potentially negative effects of AI.  
 
In the Netherlands, the Dutch Network on Media Literacy helps foster media literacy among Dutch society, focussing 
on both resilience against risks and the opportunities AI offers. In the entire educational system, skills such as critical 
and structured thinking are becoming increasingly necessary. In this context, the reform of the curriculum for primary 
and secondary education is important. The new core educational objective on digital literacy as recently launched for 
primary and secondary education, considers four domains: 1) practical ICT skills, 2) media literacy, 3) digital information 
skills, 4) computational thinking. Students will acquire knowledge about digital technology, learn how to collaborate 
with them in a critical and (self)conscious manner, and assess the opportunities and risks involved in using them, which 
is all very relevant for AI.  
 
The AI Act lists a number of factors that weigh in when promoting AI literacy, but these need further fleshing out to 
provide sufficient guidance. In the context, the Dutch privacy authority has published a short guide to promote AI 
literacy within organizations that develop AI-systems.260 
 
The Dutch government has an active policy to address disinformation and fake news, taking into account new 
possibilities based on AI. In its letter of 17 June 2024 it has reported its progress to Dutch parliament.261 Promoting 
media literacy of Dutch citizens was mentioned as one of the policy measures. Special attention will also be aimed at 
the requirements in the AI Act for promoting AI literacy and AI awareness, as it refers to the measures that providers 
and deployers shall need to undertake to ensure a sufficient level of AI literacy of their staff and other persons dealing 
with AI systems that are in use by organisations.  
 
 
Continue providing means to facilitate compliance with the AI Act and other regulations under the 
Digital Single Market 
 
Stakeholders from industry highlighted the lack of practical clarity in regulatory instruments related to AI-based services 
and products. Most recently, this was iterated in the ministerial declaration of the D9+ Ministerial Meeting in 
Copenhagen where the group called on the next Commission “to prioritize the implementation of the newly adopted 
legislation, and review the acquis of digital regulation focusing on its effectiveness, efficiency, coherence and the impact 
of cumulative digital regulation on innovation and competitiveness with a view to identify synergies, undue burdens 
and gaps in the Digital Single Market’s regulatory framework”.262 Similarly, the observation on facilitating regulatory 
compliance for industry was highlighted by a recent position paper by VNO-NCW and MKB-Nederland – two industry 
representative groups – to the members of the Netherlands Standing Committee for Digital Affairs. Specifically, the

position paper calls for “a harmonized practical explanation of the complex legal rules is of great importance for 
promoting the development and application of AI. Standards play an important role in this. Supervisors have a role to 
support companies, large and small, preventively, and proactively in the practical application of the complex legal rules 
and thus contribute to limiting the high regulatory burden”.263 
 
It is worthwhile to note that the European Union has taken action on this. Notably, by setting up procurement grants 
to develop “harmonised frameworks, tools and infrastructure at European level to support compliance with the AI Act 
that have been tested in practice by under-resourced SMEs and public authorities”.264 The Netherlands can play an 
important role here and one suggested approach is to assess how rules and regulations interplay with each other.  
 
Government response 
The Dutch government notes that the AI Act entered into force in August 2024, and will be fully applicable two years 
later, with a number of provision becoming applicable before August 2026. The Netherlands’ government is working 
on the implementation of the AI Act in the government and the private sector, as well as the supervision on and the 
enforcement of the AI Act. 
 
The Dutch government acknowledges the large amount of EU digital regulation. In the EU Telecom Council on 6 
December 2024, the Netherlands has addressed the theme of better regulation in the digital domain and proposed 
to particularly discuss the burden for SMEs in next Council meetings. The Netherlands has also welcomed the 
announcement by the European Commission to prioritise an assessment that would identify whether the digital acquis 
– all agreed EU regulation in the digital domain - reflect the needs of SMEs.  
 
The Dutch government has called upon the European Commission to strictly enforce the evaluation clauses of the 
legislation under the digital rulebook.265 Additionally, the Dutch government has spoken out in favour of a review of 
the entire digital rulebook as a whole when all laws have been implemented. Through such a review, the effectiveness 
and interplay of the legislation can be mapped and improved. 
 
The Dutch government is working on establishing regulatory sandboxes for the AI Act. In 2024, a pilot was conducted 
to gather information on the practical aspects of operating a sandbox and to receive input from stakeholders. An 
important aspect of the AI Act sandbox is ‘regulatory learning’. According to this principle, the insights and learned 
lessons from regulatory sandboxes on the application of the AI Act should be shared broadly within the AI-ecosystem 
and with policy makers. An important point of attention for the Dutch government in the further implementation is 
how regulatory sandboxes can contribute to harmonised application of the AI Act.  
 
 
Develop a coherent and unified strategy to retain and attract talent around AI 
 
For the Netherlands, attracting AI talent from abroad is particularly important due to the country's ambitions. While it 
boasts a strong educational system, the Stakeholder Team has observed that the demand for specialized AI skills 
exceeds the supply of homegrown talent.  To maintain its competitive edge in the global AI race, the Netherlands 
needs to attract top-tier international talent to bridge these gaps.

Developing and retaining talent in the Netherlands is also a matter of ensuring diversity and inclusion, which is not yet 
fully integrated into the country's AI sector. Although the Netherlands is known for its open, multicultural society, there 
is still work to be done in creating diverse teams that represent a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences. 
This diversity is essential for addressing biases in AI models and ensuring that the technology benefits all sectors of 
society266. Furthermore, building inclusive talent pipelines that encourage participation from women, minorities, and 
underrepresented groups will be critical to both the ethical and practical development of AI technologies. The Dutch 
government and institutions have acknowledged this challenge and yet, the Stakeholder Team has advised for more 
deliberate efforts to integrate these diverse perspectives into AI development. 
 
To attract and nurture talent, the Netherlands could enhance its international collaborations to foster a more 
orchestrated effort in knowledge exchange. Dutch universities and research institutions already have strong ties to 
European and global partners267, but there is room for more structured and frequent exchanges of expertise. 
Strengthening collaborations with other hubs internationally and other parts of Europe can help the Netherlands 
remain at the forefront of AI advancements. Such exchanges—whether through academic partnerships, joint research 
initiatives, or cross-border innovation projects—will allow practitioners to continuously update their skills, learn from 
global best practices, and contribute to a shared global vision for AI development.  
 
In reflection to these observations, it was recommended that the Netherlands develop a coherent and unified strategy 
to retain and attract talent around AI. This ought to include plans on attracting foreign talent (both technical and non-
technical), plans on diversity and inclusion, as well as knowledge exchanges. 
 
Government response 
The Dutch government is committed to developing and retaining AI talent, so that we can develop (generative) AI that 
meets European norms and values. This is also of added value for the digital open strategic autonomy of Europe. 
Through the Action Plan Green and Digital Jobs, the government is tackling the issue of labour market shortages in 
the climate and digital transition.268 The AINed program is an example of an initiative focused at the implementation 
of digital technology by businesses.  
 
In 2024, this cabinet also announced the National Strengthening Plan for Microchip-talent. This plan aims to train 
additional technical talent for the microchip industry as soon as possible. This is badly needed and urgent: up to and 
including 2030, the expectation is that there is a growth in the talent need of 38,000 additional technically trained 
people. To improve the location climate for the microchip industry in the Netherlands, there is more than 2 billion 
available from the central government. Specifically for the talent task, up to and including 2030, € 450 million is 
incidentally available and from 2031 € 80 million per year is structurally reserved.269 
 
The Dutch government is also exploring the (necessary) investments in large-scale scientific and technological 
infrastructure (including supercomputers and computational power) at the national and EU level to be competitive in 
the field of LLMs (Large Language Models) and other forms of (generative) AI, which will attract and retain talent.
