## Recommendations

### Recommendation 1: Evaluation and Compliance Indicators.
Evaluation and Compliance Indicators. While the proposal includes quantitative measurement indicators, it is also crucial to design a qualitative process, such as the legal dimension of RAM, which could be a new application of RAM in the future, to complement the quantitative indicators. Moreover, it is essential to seek support from international organizations in creating these indicators, as some, like AI adoption rates, have proven to be complex to design and measure. In line with this, it is

### Recommendation 2: European Union. This is crucial for the Dominican Republic to stay at the forefront of AI regulation.
European Union. This is crucial for the Dominican Republic to stay at the forefront of AI regulation. In line with the above, it is recommended that dialogues be established and the experience of countries in Latin America that have initiated regulatory discussions on AI be studied. In particular, it is recommended that cases such as Brazil, Chile, and Peru, which have bills in different processing stages, be reviewed. In line with this, although the ENIA proposes developing a Code of Ethics, th

Promoting policies in this area has a dual purpose. On the one hand, it is recommended to study the uses of AI for culture and heritage preservation, promote positive adoption, and take advantage of its opportunities for creation and preservation. However, the impact often involving regulatory discussions in areas such as those mentioned above regarding intellectual property and copyright must also be addressed. 30 5.2. Drive an agenda on opportunities and impacts of AI on the environment. While

RAM lack of data and granularity was evident. Along these lines, they should start with general data such as those collected by the OECD at the country level and then more granular in the ICT sector, particularly AI. It is recommended that the data required by the OECD in the Frascati and Oslo manuals be reviewed, together with those used in AI indices such as the ILIA, the Government

AI Readiness Index 82, and the AI index 83 . 6.2. Collect economic and labour data. A significant gap in RAM is data on talent demand, adoption levels, and AI spending at the industry level. Along these lines, relevant action must be taken to collect this information from the state and in alliance with the private sector. For many of these data, there is no standardised methodology for collecting them, so it is suggested not only to determine if it is possible to collect the data requested in th

Along these same lines, there are no patents, and it has low participation in open-source repositories such as GitHub. The ENIA must promote both academic research and the generation of incentives for patenting and involvement in open-source development spaces. For this, it is recommended that international experience be followed and scholarship policies promoted for the formation of advanced capital, the creation of research centres, and academic exchanges, among others. 7.2.

Foreword
We have officially entered the Age of Artificial Intelligence. The world is now set to change at a pace not seen in decades, 
even centuries. AI-based tools and applications make our lives easier, smoother, and more prosperous. They help us move efficiently, 
get informed, get credit, get a job, and get our taxes done.
But in its current form, AI reproduces and amplifies many social challenges we face. It is unacceptable that around a third of the 
world’s population still lacks adequate internet access. Upstream, the AI industry is highly concentrated, with just two countries
– the United States and China – and a dozen companies accounting for a more significant sector share. This can lead only to greater 
inequality of outcomes – including gender disparities – downstream. Non-diverse AI teams, unrepresentative datasets, and opaque 
and biased algorithms can cause harm, particularly to those already vulnerable, whether companies or individuals, children and 
young people, women, or entire democracies.
That is why UNESCO drafted the Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, adopted in 2021 by 193 countries to ensure 
AI delivers fair, sustainable, and inclusive outcomes. The Recommendation is based on the protection and promotion of human 
rights, human dignity, and environmental sustainability, and these values are then translated into principles such as accountability, 
transparency, and privacy. The Recommendation also sets out concrete policy actions that governments can draw on to steer 
technological developments in a responsible direction, premised on the belief that light-touch regulation, which has until now 
remained the norm, is insufficient. We need capable governments that are well equipped, in terms of competencies, institutions 
and laws, to frame responsible AI development and protect the rule of law online, and public and private developers accountable 
for putting human rights and fundamental freedoms – not profits or geopolitical considerations – first.
The Readiness Assessment Methodology (RAM) is a diagnostic tool intended to assist Member States in upholding their commitment 
to the Recommendation by helping them understand how prepared they are to implement AI ethically and responsibly for all 
their citizens. By highlighting institutional, regulatory, or data gaps and obstacles, the RAM enables UNESCO to tailor support for 
governments to fill those gaps to ensure an ethical AI ecosystem aligned with the Recommendation.
The Dominican Republic was one of the first countries selected to implement the RAM to support its efforts in creating and 
implementing its national AI strategy. We applaud the initiative the Dominican Republic government has taken to develop an AI 
strategy that prioritises ethics and governance and thank it for inviting UNESCO to assist in this endeavour.
The report presented here reveals challenges and the Dominican Republic’s strong commitment to reap AI’s benefits while 
protecting its citizens. The government launched its National Artificial Intelligence Strategy (NAIS), which was developed while 
the RAM was implemented, allowing the leading team to incorporate UNESCO’s recommendations into the policy document.
One of the key recommendations of this report is to implement the NAIS and develop a robust institutional arrangement to 
measure its impact comprehensively, just as the RAM does. Robust institutions and broad support of the policy are key elements 
for its successful implementation in the years to come. Notably, the RAM reveals the pressing need to update data protection and 
cybersecurity legislation to meet AI’s challenges. Additionally, a thoughtful reflection must be made to determine if a broad AI 
regulation is required based on the specific legal landscape of the country. The report also highlights several areas the Dominican 
government has been actively working on. For example, in the case of open data, the Dominican Republic is ranked 60 out of 187 
in the Open Data Inventory and has an existing Open Data Policy, but the country has not signed the International Open Data 
Charter. Challenges remain in many areas. For example, rules for government procurement of AI systems, disinformation, and redress 
mechanisms for harm caused by AI systems do not yet exist.
There are several challenges regarding the social and environmental aspects of AI. Although the Dominican Republic has an ongoing 
Gender Equality agenda, the RAM underlines significant gender gaps in STEM. Furthermore, there is a great challenge in providing 
internet access to all populations, especially those in rural areas. There is also no specific policy to address the impacts of AI on the 
environment or for the use of AI in the preservation of cultural heritage.

The science and education dimension reveals comparatively low public expenditure on research and development (0.086% of 
GDP), a low number of authors publishing AI work (an average of 10 per year), and a low number of publications (less than 70 
scientific articles on AI in the last ten years). These numbers are consistent with the country having no AI research centres nor many 
universities offering undergraduate or graduate programs dedicated to AI. The NAIS aims to address many of these gaps.
The final section of this report presents a set of recommendations that can support the NAIS currently being implemented. This set 
of comprehensive yet focused recommendations includes prioritizing personal data protection and cybersecurity laws to address 
the gaps in existing legislation and strengthening public sector capacities in assessing and implementing AI tools, relying on the 
ethical principles of the UNESCO Recommendation.
Several recommendations also highlight the need to collect more data about the research, development, innovation and 
entrepreneurship AI ecosystem. The RAM recommendations are based on partial data collection because relevant information 
did not exist. Furthermore, more economical and labour data are required to assess the Dominican ecosystem further and provide 
more comprehensive recommendations. The report also provides recommendations for developing policies that both use the 
power of AI and protect people from it in the areas of environment, culture, and rural development.
Overall, this report presents a fundamentally optimistic vision that we at UNESCO share: that ethical governance and responsible 
regulation of AI are entirely consistent with innovation and economic growth and are essential for ensuring a technological 
ecosystem that benefits the public good. With the RAM data and this report, along with the NAIS, the Dominican Republic has a 
clear roadmap for how to get there.
It was a pleasure working with the Dominican Republic’s government to conduct this exercise. We are grateful for their commitment 
to the RAM and their interest in incorporating the recommendations in the NAIS. I am sure that by following this path, the Dominican 
Republic will be able to reap the benefits of AI while ensuring that AI technologies deliver fair, sustainable, and inclusive outcomes.

Executive Summary
In November 2021, 193 UNESCO Member States adopted the Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence. 
This global standard aims to harness the positive impact of AI while addressing its inherent risks. Countries around the 
world are now in the process of implementing the Recommendation, and UNESCO supports them through various capacity-
building efforts. In particular, the Dominican Republic was selected in 2023 as one of the first countries in the region to study its 
AI ecosystem through the Readiness Assessment Methodology (RAM) and thus support the development of its national strategy 
(ENIA) launched in 2023.
The Dominican Republic published its ENIA after the conclusion of the draft of this report, using its input, but before this publication. 
However, it does not yet have a specific regulatory framework. The ENIA seeks to advance many of the aspects identified in this 
report, which will allow the implementation of UNESCO’s recommendations on the ethical use of AI.
In the legal dimension, there are challenges in updating personal data protection and cybersecurity laws. The Dominican Republic 
has carried out diagnostics, and there are plans for such updates. Along these lines, progress must continue in line with the Digital 
Agenda 2030 in better open data policies and increasing trust in state digital systems and services. In addition, there are areas 
where the specific challenges of AI have not been addressed, such as procurement processes, procedural guarantees, culture, 
or impacts on the environment.
Considerations of social and cultural dimensions are central to deploying AI systems ethically and responsibly, avoiding biases 
throughout their life cycle. In this line, various issues are addressed, such as the gender gap, urban-rural, and diversity, among 
others. The policies on gender with the PLANEG and other more specific policies are highlighted, but gaps continue to exist at the 
STEM level and, more specifically, in ICT. At this point, there are no performance gaps at the school level, but rather, they occur as 
they advance in the educational system, which is why the need for references and affirmative action is highlighted. Along these 
lines, work must be done on the urban-rural gaps in internet access.
The scientific and educational dimension is key to the technological development of the country and the incorporation of ethical 
principles from the beginning of the AI life cycle. Along these lines, the Dominican Republic must move forward in having more 
researchers in the area and promoting their scientific production and collaboration with the industry. In line with the above, 
the country’s participation in developing open-source software or patents is barely detected. However, there are programs in 
tertiary education that seek to fill the gaps in human capital, so progress is being made in the right direction.
In the economic dimension, which considers critical aspects in development and adoption along with the adaptation of the labour 
market, the Dominican Republic barely has data that makes it possible to establish a baseline. This puts particular emphasis on the 
recommendation to improve data collection from the ecosystem.
The technical and infrastructure dimensions address the country’s installed capacity to implement AI-based solutions across different 
sectors. In this dimension, a gap regarding connectivity and access to high-speed internet is being worked on. Along the same 
lines, the country has no relevant computing capacity.
Based on the results, eight recommendations are generated. The priority is the implementation of the ENIA, together with adequate 
monitoring and evaluation. With this, it is recommended that regulatory updating be worked on by discussing an eventual general 
AI law and sectoral and/or related laws (e.g., personal data). The above must go hand in hand with training programs in the public 
sector and a greater push for diversity and inclusion policies that allow for the responsible development of AI in the country in 
accordance with UNESCO recommendations. For the development of policies, a fundamental element is to prioritise data collection 
on research, development, adoption, productivity, work, etc., that allow for the generation of adequate baselines. Finally, it is 
recommended to strongly promote research in AI and collaboration with the industry.

### Page 12

The Dominican Republic has recognized the challenges it faces and has an ENIA that aims to advance in covering the gaps and taking 
advantage of AI’s potential. In this sense, this report contributes to a greater understanding of the ecosystem that will contribute 
to a successful implementation of the ENIA with evaluations and updates in the medium term.
This initiative is part of UNESCO’s effort to contribute to a more ethical and promising future for AI systems globally. UNESCO is 
committed to upholding values such as respect, protection, and promotion of human rights, fundamental freedoms, human dignity, 
and environmental and ecosystem well-being, ensuring diversity and inclusion, and fostering peaceful, just, and interconnected 
societies. When properly managed, the emergence of new technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence, can be harnessed for the 
collective benefit of humanity. In this context, the RAM ensures that all nations can achieve a better future, leaving no one behind.

DIAGNOSIS OF THE NATIONAL 
SITUATION IN ARTIFICIAL 
INTELLIGENCE
At the time of the application of the RAM, the Dominican Republic was developing the ENIA with the support of UNESCO and CAF, 
which contemplated the implementation of the RAM in the process and the incorporation of the UNESCO Recommendation on 
the Ethics of AI. Before the ENIA, there was no sectoral prioritisation of government intervention related to AI, and citizens were 
not informed about the use of AI in the provision of public services.
The Ministry of the Presidency was mandated to create the ENIA and establish governance, which did not exist when applying 
the RAM. Notwithstanding the above, the National Innovation Policy, in its Governance axis, mandates the creation of the General 
Directorate of Innovation and Digital Development, which will be responsible for the governance of AI.
The OGTIC considers that the most important obstacle to developing policies and regulations related to AI is politicians’ and 
decision-makers awareness of the issue. However, after the massification of the large language models in 2023, greater awareness 
has been generated, and the Dominican government instructed and, using inputs of this report, published the ENIA.

### Page 14

LEGAL DIMENSION 
This section will discuss the legal dimension. The regulatory framework in which AI is situated is crucial to ensure the ethical 
deployment of AI. The legal and regulatory framework should include effective mechanisms to safeguard and uphold citizens’ 
rights, as well as to monitor, mitigate and compensate for any unintended adverse outcomes resulting from the deployment of AI 
systems. Examples of the legal framework include rules relating to AI, data protection and privacy, data sharing and information 
accessibility, procurement, due process and accountability, online security and content integrity, and public sector capacity.
AI POLICY AND REGULATION
The Dominican Republic launched its ENIA after the completion of the draft of this report in 2023 through a presidential decree. 
There is no specific law on AI either 1  , but there are related regulations, such as data protection, which will be discussed later. As the 
superior framework mandated by the ENIA, there is the 2030 Digital Agenda 2  and the Innovation Policy (PNI) 3 .
	
Regarding the ENIA , according to what was reported by OGTIC, the team in charge was diverse in terms of gender and 
immigrant participation. The ENIA contains an ethical component as a relevant section and addresses potential impacts of AI on 
human rights. Along these lines, not only will the knowledge of consultants and the government team be incorporated, but they 
also conducted a public consultation with support from CAF in July, 20234 .
The implementation of the ENIA will be under the Digital Transformation and Innovation Cabinets, led by the Ministry of the 
Presidency and the OGTIC. However, the PNI mandates the creation of the General Directorate of Innovation and Digital Development 
as the body responsible for this strategy, and the ENIA contemplates creating a multi-sector coalition to implement the human 
talent and research and development axes. However, no budget allocations are contemplated in the ENIA; only the PNI 2030 aims 
to reach 1% of GDP for Research and Development (R&D) in 2030. Finally, there are no plans for AI impact evaluations or specific 
binding regulations.
DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY
The Dominican Republic is not classified in the Cybersecurity Index 5 , an indicator required by the RAM.
The Dominican Republic has a Personal Data Protection Law (Law No. 172-13) 6 However, this has not been evaluated, and despite 
the consensus that it should be updated, it has not been possible to modify it. The ENIA contemplates updating this regulation.
Regarding content, the law grants users control over their data and allows them to request deletion in Article 14, which talks about 
the rights of rectification and cancellation: “Every person has the right to have them rectified, updated, and, when appropriate, 
deleted, the personal data of which it is the owner and that is included in a data bank. Notification and consent are also mentioned 
in Article 74 in special cases regarding certain protected data. In addition, specific rules are incorporated on sensitive information, 
compensation devices in cases of infringement and the protection of privacy and respect for private and family life, which is also 
reflected in the Constitution of the Republic 7 .
On the other hand, the law does not address transparency requirements regarding data use, data minimisation and impact 
assessment on data protection or privacy. Furthermore, there is no specialised data protection entity. 
The Dominican Republic has a score of 59 on the Open Data Inventory  8, ranking it 60th out of 187. On the other hand, the Dominican 
Republic has not signed the International Open Data Charter 9 .

### Page 15

The Dominican Republic has a National Framework for data exchange in Decree 92-22 10 , which establishes the National 
Framework for Government Interoperability, which defines and guides the exchange of information between public institutions 
of the Dominican State for the strengthening of the Digital Government and the measurement of progress in interoperability of 
public institutions. However, this framework has not been evaluated. Furthermore, it is focused on public sector institutions, so it 
does not address the exchange with private ones.
In terms of Open Data, in 2022, the National Open Data Policy was created through Decree 103-22, 11 which seeks to establish 
guidelines regarding the access, use, reuse and redistribution of public data. The application is mandatory for executive 
branch agencies.
In addition, there is an Open Data Portal of the Government of the Dominican Republic 12 . The objective of this tool is that people 
can have access to the open data produced by Dominican public institutions and thus transform them into reusable information, 
creating the opportunity to exchange or cross-reference information between databases and promote the development of 
applications, both from the Public Administration as well as from Civil Society.
Since information is constantly being created, the portal is a living site that is constantly updated. This portal has a search engine 
and catalogues of various sectoral categories belonging to government organizations. Some of this data is already available on 
other sites, thanks to various initiatives; however, the portal integrates all open publications from public institutions.
To date, the open data policy has not been evaluated and does not cover issues such as the availability and access to research data

PROCUREMENT LAWS AND POLICIES 
In terms of procurement, no laws or policies cover products or services that include AI components or certifications, but this is 
considered in the ENIA.

### Page 16

FREEDOM OF INFORMATION LAWS AND ACCESS TO KNOWLEDGE LAWS
In terms of freedom of information and access to information, there is Law No. 200-04: General Law of Free Access to Public 
Information 13. However, the effectiveness of this law has not been evaluated, nor does it have specific elements of AI. Despite this, 
considered more generally, public institutions may be subject to audit independent of whether they use AI systems or not. Unless 
legislation provides otherwise, any public sector system, regardless of whether it has AI or not, may be subject to audits.
PROCEDURAL GUARANTEES AND ACCOUNTABILITY
In terms of procedural guarantees and accountability, due process is a constitutional guarantee 14 in the Dominican Republic, 
enshrined in Article 69. This article guarantees that people have the right to obtain effective judicial protection when exercising 
their rights and legitimate interests, respecting due process. However, the laws have not been evaluated in this regard and do not 
incorporate elements requiring people to be informed when interacting with AI systems. In line with the above, no laws or policies 
establish oversight, compensation or recourse mechanisms against damages from AI systems.
ONLINE SECURITY AND CONTENT INTEGRITY
In terms of online security and content integrity, Law No. 53-07 15 on High-Tech Crimes and Crimes aims to protect systems that 
use information and communication technologies and their content. In addition, it covers elements of crimes through the use of 
these technologies. However, it does not cover AI specifically and does not particularly address things like misinformation or hate 
speech.PUBLIC SECTOR CAPACITY 
To improve digital skills in the public sector, the Dominican Republic has a Program for the development and strengthening of 
technical capabilities of ICT personnel that seeks to certify public officials in the use of digital technologies and the “Digital Public 
Servants” Project , which consists of awareness days on digital culture and literacy courses for public officials. However, there are 
no programs that persist over time or that are specific to AI.

SOCIAL AND CULTURAL DIMENSION
In this section, the social and cultural dimensions are discussed. Social and cultural dimensions are crucial to evaluating ethical 
components in the deployment of AI systems, such as mechanisms to avoid the appearance of biases throughout the life cycle of 
the AI system and the creation of a fair and inclusive AI ecosystem. In this sense, this section addresses topics such as the inclusion 
of women in the development environment of science, technology, engineering, mathematics (STEM) and AI, as well as the 
incorporation of social and cultural diversity to ensure the ethical application of AI. In addition, it includes the level of acceptance 
and attitudes of the general public towards AI, the consideration of environmental and sustainable criteria, health, social well-being 
and culture in creating AI solutions.
DIVERSITY, INCLUSION AND EQUITY
IIn this area, various gaps are measured that can leave groups excluded and vulnerable to the impacts of AI. In terms of internet 
use, it is measured that the gender gap in internet use (woman/man) is 0.963 17, but there is no data in the ITU 18 to measure the 
urban-rural gap, but based on the ONE 19 In 2022, 49.2% of urban households surveyed had internet access compared to only 30.6% 
of rural households. This represents a gap between the two of more than 35%.
	
In terms of education and participation in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), higher education 
graduates are 20.27% men and 7.02% women 20, which reveals a relevant gap. When analysing the expectations of girls and boys 
to study STEM careers, there is no data in the OECD report on PISA 21, but girls have a better performance in mathematics and 
science than boys (324 versus 327 in mathematics and 331 versus 340 in sciences) 22, which reveals that a gap is being generated 
between school and higher education.
	
To address the above, a Gender Statistics Strategy was published in 2022 23. The objective is to improve gender statistics and use 
a transversal gender approach in statistical systems. This policy lasts four years, covering from 2021 to 2024. This policy is under the 
framework of the National Plan for Gender Equality and Equity (PLANEG III) 24, which incorporates various areas such as education, 
health, economic autonomy, participation in political and social, environmental, gender violence and digital technologies.
Particularly in the field of digital technologies (page 183 PLANEG III), the following objectives are proposed:.
••
Incorporate gender equality and intersectionality in the design, planning, execution, and evaluation of public policies 
regarding digital development, science, and technology in the country.
••
Incorporate the availability of quality, accessible and free content, public services and digital applications that contribute 
to women’s autonomy.
••
Develop concrete strategies and mechanisms for appropriating digital technologies, science, and technology, focusing 
on gender equality and intersectionality, to stimulate female leadership development in these sectors.More Women in 
Sciences (Ministry of Women).
••
Develop technical and conceptual capacities in the institutions responsible for implementing Planet III, including the Ministry 
of Women, to strategically use digital technologies that contribute to effective, timely and innovative management of their 
policy-leading functions.
Additionally, action plans have been established to fulfil these objectives (p. 192 to 199).

### Page 19

PLANEG III has not been evaluated, but PLANEG II has 25, which can be reviewed in summary between pages 14 and 17 of PLANEG 
III. Furthermore, some matrices and baselines are included in the annexe to PLANEG III for subsequent evaluation.
To address the urban-rural gap, there is no specific agenda, but there are actions and measures in the 2030 Digital Agenda 26 that 
aim to reduce the gap. Some proposed measures are the use of the Telecommunications Development Fund (FDT) to support the 
deployment of last-mile community networks in rural and semi-urban areas without private investment (see p.36) or the promotion 
(without specifying instruments) of initiatives that promote access to services and opportunities by reducing disparity. This policy 
has neither been evaluated nor has instruments to do so.
Specifically, regarding diversity in the IA staff, there are currently no measures or policies, but diversity is discussed in the ENIA. In line 
with this, there is no obligation for any actor to publish gender statistics, no life action standards are applied to promote diversity 
in AI, nor are there obligations in government contracts related to diversity. In the case of STEM, there are actions within PLANEG 
III that seek to address the gaps identified above.
Finally, the Dominican Republic has 0 points in the data barometer in the presence of data to train algorithms in the official language 
or indigenous languages. However, according to what OGTIC reports, the second does not apply since there are no indigenous 
languages in the country.
PUBLIC PARTICIPATION AND TRUST
The Dominican Republic has an Online Services Ranking Index (OSI) 27 of 0.6183 and an Electronic Participation Index (EPI) 28 of 
0.4545, ranking it at number 86 worldwide. Figures 1 and 2 show a gap in this .
 area, being behind the regional and world average. However, in the Caribbean and Central America context, the Dominican Republic 
is above average in leadership positions.

Regarding trust data on government websites and applications, this is 48% 29. Specifically regarding the perception of AI, there is 
no data30 .
ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY POLICIES 
The Dominican Republic does not have policies to address the impact of AI on the environment and sustainability; the ENIA only 
addresses its use to confront elements of the climate crisis. For example, the strategy plans to disseminate ecological data and 
promote research on sustainability and the environment through the #YoSoyFuturoRD HUB. In line with the above, the Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) or the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria are not mentioned, and the potential impact 
of AI on land and water is not considered, nor are assessments of the environmental impact of the use of AI.
HEALTH AND SOCIAL WELL-BEING
As part of the 2030 Digital Agenda and its 2021-2024 action plan, a series of initiatives linked to digital health are considered, 
such as the Establishment of a National Telemedicine Policy between 2021 and 2023, a single digital health file between 2022 and 
2024, a Health Sector Balanced Scorecard between 2021 and 2024, the Digitalization of the Health Registry between 2021 and 
2024, Contact Tracing and Vaccination Registry between 2021 and 2024, a National eHealth Strategy between 2021 and 2022, 
a Mobile Digital Hospital between 2022 and 2023, Connected Medical Emergencies between 2023 and 2024 and the Electronic 
Prescription between 2022 and 2024. However, beyond this action plan, the progress of the aforementioned initiatives was not 
found. Furthermore, there is no mention of AI in the 2030 Digital Agenda or the SNS Strategic Plan 31, but it is addressed in the ENIA.
The OGTIC complements the results of the independent study “The State of the Digital Transformation in Health in the Dominican 
Republic” that was presented in September 2022 during the 2nd. Latin American Digital Health Congress 32. The investigation cited 
among the weaknesses the pending implementation of primary care, electronic medical records, telemedicine and a regulatory 
and incentive framework for digital health.
In terms of evaluation, although it is not direct, in 2023, the Health Technology Assessment was launched in the Dominican Republic 
together with the Pan American Health Organization 33.

The health strategies do not cover the impact of AI on children and adolescents specifically, and the effect of AI on mental health 
is not considered.
CULTURE
No policies or strategies address the use of AI for the preservation of cultural heritage.

SCIENTIFIC AND EDUCATIONAL 
DIMENSION
In this section, the scientific and educational dimensions will be discussed. Since scientific and educational components 
contribute significantly to the advancement of AI, assessing them becomes a relevant method to assess a country’s readiness for 
AI development. The scientific aspect is measured by the country’s performance in research and innovation (R&I), which includes 
research and development (R&D) spending, research production, ethical AI research, and AI innovation production. AI talents. On the 
other hand, the educational aspect is evaluated through the country’s performance in educational aspects such as educational 
strategy, educational infrastructure, curriculum content, educational achievements, and public access to AI education.
INVESTIGATION AND DEVELOPMENT 
There is no data on the Gross Expenditure on R&D (GERD) of the Dominican Republic as an average of GDP in the OECD or World 
Bank, but based on a source from the Dominican government, 0.086% of GDP is reported 34, which is low in comparison to world 
or regional leaders. When trying to disaggregate the data to Natural Sciences and Engineering, there is no data in international 
sources or the Public Investment Report of the Dominican government 35. In terms of budget allocations for R&D, data does not 
exist at the OECD level either, but if the public investment report is taken, there was a programmed expenditure of RD$9 million in 
2022 in general administration and 0 in education. Particularly in AI, there is no data on state R&D funding.
	
In terms of research, based on the Country Activity Tracker of the Emerging Technology Observatory 36 they have 33 publications, 
equivalent to 0.0029 per thousand inhabitants. According to data calculated by the National Center for Artificial Intelligence of Chile 
(CENIA) 37, between 2014 and 2023 the Dominican Republic has published 68 articles related to AI, equivalent to 0.006 publications 
per thousand inhabitants. In terms of citations, based on the CAT, there are 263 citations, equivalent to 0.023 citations per thousand 
inhabitants. When using CENIA data, 1073 citations are obtained, corresponding to 0.096 citations per thousand inhabitants. 
Specifically on ethics, there is no data from publications and conferences. There are also no research centres dedicated to AI ethics 
or data on departments that address the topic.
	
There is no open source for calculating AI researchers, so we worked with CENIA’s data. Extracting the authors of the papers 
found there are, on average, 10 active authors per year between 2014 and 2022. The table below shows the active authors per year 
(who published in said year):
The methodology regarding what is considered AI differs, which is why the numbers are different for both sources.

The Dominican Republic does not have Grandmasters on Kaggle 38. Kaggle is a data science competition site. Grandmasters are 
those who achieve the highest level of performance, which measures the quality and quantity of work produced. In particular, 
Grandmasters 39 require 5 gold medals in competitions, one gold medal in solo, 5 gold medals and 5 silver medals in databases, 
15 gold medals in notebooks, 50 gold medals in discussions and 500 total medals in discussions.
The Dominican Republic does not have AI patents between 2020 and 2022, which follows the pattern of most countries in the 
region, whose level of patenting is low in this area. In terms of open software, the Dominican Republic has 30 users who have 
contributed a total of 823 commits to AI repositories on GitHub. This is equivalent to 27.43 commits per user and 0.073 commits 
per 1,000 inhabitants. The above is low compared to leading countries in the region such as Chile or Brazil.:
EDUCATION
The Dominican Republic does not have laws or policies to integrate AI into the educational system, which is the norm so far in 
most countries in the region.
	
In terms of infrastructure, according to UNESCO data from 2016 40. Primary establishments have 23.16% internet access. 
In addition, based on 2013 data, primary establishments have 46.48% access to computers for pedagogical purposes, and secondary 
schools have 71.83% based on 2018 data.
	
In terms of curricular content, a total of 11 tertiary education programs related to the field of AI, Machine Learning and Data 
Science are currently offered in the country. These programs include two undergraduate courses, seven diploma courses and two 
master’s programs, distributed among various universities in the country. This shows important progress since several countries in 
the region have few or no programs.
 Below is a breakdown of these programs, considering the ranking of each university according to the Web Ranking of Universities41 .

The current educational program offers no modules dedicated to digital anthropology, philosophy of technology, AI ethics, or related 
disciplines. Emphasis is mainly placed on technical rather than ethical aspects. While some of these programs may address ethical 
issues, they are not discussed explicitly or given adequate attention.
In terms of primary and secondary education, based on the Initial Level Design 50, the Primary Level Design 51 and the Secondary 
Level Design 52, elements of AI, or even more basic familiarisation with programming or digital resilience, are not incorporated.
In terms of graduates, according to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics 53. The average number of STEM graduates in higher education 
by 2022 is 11.55%, and ICT graduates are 3.72%. There is no data on graduates in data science, machine learning or robotics, PhDs in 
AI, or post-docs in AI.
In terms of the ranking in data science in the Coursera World Skills Report 54 The Dominican Republic is in 63rd place globally and, 
particularly in data science, has a 54% that places it within the competitive group.
Regarding public access to educational material in AI, there are courses such as diploma courses (e.g. https://itla.edu.do/inteligencia-
artificial/ ), but they are not aimed at the general public, nor are they free.

ECONOMIC DIMENSION
 The economic dimension considers relevant aspects within the ecosystem in which AI systems are developed and deployed, such as 
those related to the labour market, intermediate consumption, and AI investment and production. The dynamism and skill level of 
the labour market and spending on intermediate consumption, investment, and production are crucial aspects for assessing the 
performance and readiness of the specific ecosystems in which AI is implemented.
LABOR MARKETS
There is no data on job offers requiring AI skills or on employees working as data science experts. It is also impossible to measure the 
relative penetration of AI skills or concentration of AI talent by LinkedIn, as there is not enough data to be representative. Despite 
the absence of data, a relevant topic in the ENIA is the impact of AI on labor market.
INTERMEDIATE CONSUMPTION
There is no data on companies’ spending on AI services. Publications on ICT 55 business activity only covers access and use of the 
Internet, social networks, email, web pages and electronic means of payment. There is also no data on the national production 
and import of AI products and services, but inferring information from Innovation in Formal Business Activity in 2022 56 Since most 
innovations are new for companies but not for the market, it can be inferred that they are mainly imported.
INVESTMENT AND PRODUCTION
There is no data on commercial companies’ spending on R&D in programming, consulting, and other computer-related activities. 
There is also no data on GDP per capita for SIC code 62.0 (Programming, consulting and other computer-related activities) based on 
publications from the National Statistics Office .57 In terms of high-tech exports as a percentage of trade 58, the Dominican Republic 
has a score of 2.9 and is in position 50 based on the Global Innovation Index 59.

TECHNICAL AND INFRASTRUCTURE 
DIMENSION 
The technical and infrastructure dimensions refer to the installed capacity within countries for developing and deploying AI solutions, 
whether through their computing power, the availability of data centres, connectivity, and internet access, among other things. 
These elements are relevant enablers for developing AI systems within a country since they determine development capabilities 
based on the infrastructure available and necessary to support the processed information.
INFRASTRUCTURE AND CONNECTIVITY
In 2021, according to the World Bank 60, the percentage of people with a mobile telephone subscription was 88% of the population, 
and the percentage of people with a fixed broadband subscription was 10%. According to ITU data 61 The number of people 
subscribed to active mobile broadband was 67 per 100 inhabitants in 2021, and the average bandwidth was 102 kbit/s per 
user. Additionally, in July 2023, an average download speed of 20.58 Mbps (megabits per second) was recorded 62. Thus, in 2021, 
according to the World Bank 63, the percentage of people who use the internet is 85% of the population. In terms of mobile networks, 
the population covered by at least a 3G mobile network is 99% based on ITU information 64. Finally, in terms of 2021, according to 
the World Bank 65, the percentage of people with access to electricity is 98.1% of the population.
In terms of Gap, according to data from the Economist index 66, the gender gap score for internet access is 66.8, which is worsened 
by 8 points from the previous version. For mobile telephony, it is 62.9, which is further exacerbated by 3.2 points from the earlier 
version. In terms of the urban-rural gap in household internet access, there is no information from international sources; however, 
based on data provided by the OGCTIC, the ONE 67. In 2022, 49.2% of urban households surveyed had internet access, compared 
to 30.6% of rural households. This represents a gap between the two of more than 35%.
APPLIED STANDARDS
The Dominican Republic, through INDOCAL, is not a member of any of the committees and subcommittees related to AI and 
digital technologies, like most countries in the region. At the observer level, it is part of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27 on Information Security, 
cybersecurity and privacy. On the other hand, the Dominican Republic is one of the eligible countries in the IEEE..
COMPUTATIONAL CAPABILITIES 
In the Dominican Republic, there are no data centres in the Data Center Locations base 68 and the Data Center Map 69, which groups 
the leading companies. Based on the Data Center Journal 70, there is only one data centre operated by Kio Networks. Along these 
lines, based on the Data Center Map, the closest centres are in Puerto Rico, around 380 kilometres. Thus, in terms of data centres 
with placement 71 per million inhabitants, the Dominican Republic has a score of 1 out of 10, which means the lowest number 
relative to population.

### Page 28

26
In terms of policy, no policy addresses AI-based Cloud computing. It is mentioned in the 2030 Digital Agenda, and the ENIA, 
but specific actions are not raised when applying the RAM.
STATISTICAL PERFORMANCE 
In the statistical indicators of results 72 , the Dominican Republic has a score of 63.9, placing it in the third quintile; in data products73, 
it has a score of 59, which is distributed as 17 in social statistics, 14 in economic statistics, 11 in environmental statistics and 17 in 
institutional statistics. In data sources 74, it has 34 points, distributed in 17 in censuses, 15 in surveys and 2 in geospatial data and 
data infrastructure 75, it has 60 points..
In terms of laws or policies that establish a global framework for coherent data management and publication 76, there is the National 
Open Data Policy of the Dominican Republic in presidential decree 103-22 77. On the other hand, based on what was reported to the

RAM IMPLEMENTATION
 
To apply RAM in the Dominican Republic, an iterative and collaborative process was followed with the Government Office of 
Information and Communication Technologies (OGTIC) and the consultant in charge of developing the ENIA. The process was carried 
out at a particular speed to adequately inform the development of the ENIA and thus incorporate the recommendations into it.
	
Firstly, in line with the information-gathering work of the consultant in charge of developing the ENIA, he was asked to contribute 
background information regarding the legal dimension of said survey. In parallel, the rest of the dimensions were investigated 
based on the sources suggested by UNESCO and other additional ones if the indicators did not exist.
	
Secondly, all the information collected in the first stage was integrated, and the form was answered to identify the questions 
that required validation or information that was not available during the initial search.
	
Thirdly, an iterative process was generated to, on the one hand, incorporate new information and correct the data found, 
but, on the other, to allow the government of the Dominican Republic to review what was found and complement it based on 
its priorities and projects in development. Along these lines, a document was shared with a review period in which the questions 
that required more information or validation by OGTIC and its consultant were identified.
	
Fourthly, the background information provided by OGTIC and the consultant was taken, and those considered to complement or 
correct the information found were incorporated. Additionally, elements that the government of the Dominican Republic considers 
promoting in its ENIA or other policies were included.
	
Finally, the ENIA draft proposal is reviewed along with the results of the RAM implementation to leave some initial 
recommendations for the Dominican Republic. As of the closing date of the RAM implementation, the ENIA was not officially 
released, so the text was adjusted afterwards, checked with OGTIC's team and updated, but some elements gathered in this 
report might be outdated considering the ENIA's implementation.  However, the recommendations are linked to the draft that was 
accessed. This allows for the connection between the two processes with partial overlap. Thus, there is consistency in the agenda 
that the Dominican Republic will follow in AI.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the gaps identified in the analysis and the data that could not be collected, recommendations are made for the 
implementation of  the ENIA and future measurements of the ecosystem of the Dominican Republic.
1. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ENIA
1.1.	National Artificial Intelligence Strategy (ENIA).
This strategy, drawing from successful international experiences, is a beacon of hope for the future of AI in the Dominican Republic. 
It is recommended to establish a clear institutional framework for monitoring compliance indicators and, when appropriate, 
for updating the document. Furthermore, it seeks broad consensus across political sectors so that, in the event of a change in the 
governing coalition, the policy is not discarded as has happened in other countries in the region.
. 1.2.	
Evaluation and Compliance Indicators.
While the proposal includes quantitative measurement indicators, it is also crucial to design a qualitative process, such as the legal 
dimension of RAM, which could be a new application of RAM in the future, to complement the quantitative indicators. Moreover, it is 
essential to seek support from international organizations in creating these indicators, as some, like AI adoption rates, have proven 
to be complex to design and measure. In line with this, it is important to advance the incorporation of the Dominican Republic in 
international indices and indicators, such as the OECD, the Latin American AI Index, and the Stanford Index, among others.
2. REGULATORY UPDATE
2.1.	Regulation of AI. 
While the ENIA does propose legal and regulatory initiatives in various areas, it lacks a clear impetus to discuss the relevance of 
a specific AI regulation in the country and/or develop it. In the rapidly evolving AI landscape, it is imperative to initiate a focused 
discussion that takes into account the national and regional reality, rather than simply importing discussions from entities like the 
European Union. This is crucial for the Dominican Republic to stay at the forefront of AI regulation.
	
In line with the above, it is recommended that dialogues be established and the experience of countries in Latin America that 
have initiated regulatory discussions on AI be studied. In particular, it is recommended that cases such as Brazil, Chile, and Peru, 
which have bills in different processing stages, be reviewed.
In line with this, although the ENIA proposes developing a Code of Ethics, the implementation and control mechanisms must be 
reviewed so that this is more than a declaration and effectively protects people from the potential harm of AI systems.
Finally, it is recommended to study the development of regulatory experimentation spaces such as sandboxes in this aspect. These 
are being discussed and developed in various countries and are incorporated in laws such as those of the European Union or the 
Chilean project since they would be mechanisms that promote regulatory learning and innovation simultaneously.

### Page 31

2.2.	Complementary regulations.
While some of this is addressed in the ENIA, there is a lag in creating and updating relevant regulations. In particular, the rules on 
Personal Data Protection, Cybersecurity and Critical Digital Infrastructure, Procurement and Procedural Guarantees must be updated 
in light of the challenges of AI systems. At this point, in addition to the urgency in matters of data protection, the regulation of AI 
Acquisitions, which is addressed in the ENIA, should be a priority since it has been discussed 80 that it allows for promoting good 
practices in a faster and more agile way than strict regulation.
3. PUBLIC SECTOR CAPABILITIES 
Although some initiatives aim to strengthen the ICT capabilities of public officials, they are still incipient and do not contemplate 
mandatory nature or certifications. In this line, having an institutional framework with trained personnel is relevant, so training 
officials and establishing compulsory and constant updating mechanisms should be a priority. This is partially covered in the ENIA, 
promoting training for officials and an AI Center of Excellence. The design of incentives is a challenge that needs to be addressed 
so that certification and education instruments are effectively used
4. DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION POLICIES
4.1.	Promote a gender diversity agenda in AI. 
A significant gender gap was identified in STEM and although there is no data, it can be inferred that AI must be the same or 
worse, which coincides with existing reports 81 Although the ENIA covers the issue of focusing talent policies, this is not enough. 
The underrepresentation of women in AI, a significant gender gap identified in STEM, is a pressing issue that must be urgently 
addressed. According to the RAM, there is no gap in performance but instead in graduates and the prospects of entering the STEM 
field. Along these lines, work must be done on the design of positive discrimination initiatives, dissemination and visibility of female 
references in AI, and incentives through public purchases for diversity in teams.
4.2.	Promote an agenda with a rural focus.
The ENIA does not cover the existing infrastructure gap between rural and urban areas. The development of AI and its use in different 
areas can increase the gap in terms of quality of life if there is no adequate agenda to address it. In line with this, it is recommended 
to study promoting policies in local governments that allow promoting the ethical use of AI in more specific problems depending 
on the localities and their level of urbanity.
5. CULTURE AND ENVIRONMENT
5.1.	Drive an agenda on the impact of AI on culture and heritage.
Although intellectual property and copyright issues are addressed, the impact of AI in the world of culture, especially with the 
emergence of foundational models, is relevant. Along these lines, a topic not addressed in the ENIA is the use of AI to preserve 
cultural heritage and how the impact of AI in the creative industries will be worked on.
	
Promoting policies in this area has a dual purpose. On the one hand, it is recommended to study the uses of AI for culture and 
heritage preservation, promote positive adoption, and take advantage of its opportunities for creation and preservation. However, 
the impact often involving regulatory discussions in areas such as those mentioned above regarding intellectual property and 
copyright must also be addressed.

### Page 32

5.2.	Drive an agenda on opportunities and impacts of AI on the environment. 
While mentioned in the ENIA as a potential area from a mission-driven policy perspective, there is no specific prioritisation towards 
using AI to mitigate the climate crisis. Furthermore, there is no mention of the potential impacts that AI and its development may 
have on the environment, and no regulation addresses it. Along these lines, it is recommended to start discussions with multiple 
stakeholders on the relevance of rules around the impact of AI on the environment and move forward with a prioritised agenda 
both in this sense and in the use of AI for conservation and preservation.
It is relevant that the discussion be in-depth and anchored in the local reality. This is because incorrect regulations can curb potential 
positive uses of AI. For example, the environmental impact assessment generates an extra burden on researchers and entrepreneurs 
and would only be justified if, in fact, models were being developed in the Dominican Republic, whose high energy consumption 
could harm the environment. Otherwise, it could be overregulated and end up harming development.
6. DATA COLLECTION
6.1.	Collect data on research, development, innovation and entrepreneurship (R+D+i+e).
Hand in hand with the ENIA initiatives to strengthen statistical systems, the Dominican Republic must work to make R&D&i&e 
expenditure data available that allow for the design of policies based on evidence in the matter, since in the application of the 
RAM lack of data and granularity was evident. Along these lines, they should start with general data such as those collected by the 
OECD at the country level and then more granular in the ICT sector, particularly AI. It is recommended that the data required by 
the OECD in the Frascati and Oslo manuals be reviewed, together with those used in AI indices such as the ILIA, the Government 
AI Readiness Index 82,  and the AI index 83 .
6.2.	Collect economic and labour data. 
A significant gap in RAM is data on talent demand, adoption levels, and AI spending at the industry level. Along these lines, relevant 
action must be taken to collect this information from the state and in alliance with the private sector. For many of these data, there 
is no standardised methodology for collecting them, so it is suggested not only to determine if it is possible to collect the data 
requested in the RAM but also to explore and propose methodologies that inform public policies in these areas
7. DEVELOPMENT OF THE R&D&I ECOSYSTEM
7.1.	Drive research and innovation in AI.
The Dominican Republic has low scientific productivity in AI, which is explained by publications, the number of authors, and citations. 
Along these same lines, there are no patents, and it has low participation in open-source repositories such as GitHub. The ENIA must 
promote both academic research and the generation of incentives for patenting and involvement in open-source development 
spaces. For this, it is recommended that international experience be followed and scholarship policies promoted for the formation 
of advanced capital, the creation of research centres, and academic exchanges, among others.
7.2.	Promote industry-university collaboration for national AI development..
AI is not only developed in academia; in fact, the great advances of recent times have come from the industry. Therefore, it is 
recommended to promote policies that facilitate and encourage industry-university collaboration and technology transfer. It is also 
recommended to explore instruments such as tax incentives for hiring experts or R&D activities in the industry and collaborative 
financing instruments, among others.

8. PARTICIPATE IN THE DISCUSSION OF STANDARDS. 
The Dominican Republic is not part of the international groups discussing AI standards and certifications. Therefore, it is 
recommended that it join them not only as observers but also as members.
