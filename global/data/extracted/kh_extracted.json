The world is now set to change at a pace \nnot seen in decades, even centuries. AI-based tools and \napplications make our lives easier, smoother, and richer. \nThey help us move efficiently, get informed, get credit, \nget a job, and get our taxes done. \nBut in its current form, AI reproduces and amplifies \nmany social challenges we face. It is not acceptable that \naround a third of the world’s population still lacks \nadequate internet access. Upstream, the AI industry is \nhighly concentrated, with just two countries – the United \nStates and China – and a dozen companies accounting \nfor a major share of the sector. This can lead only to \ngreater inequality of outcomes, including gender \ndisparit",

      "text": "Adapt Regulations to Integrate Ethics of AI Cambodia should create and amend regulations across several key areas to develop and deploy AI responsibly. These regulations should foster innovation while mitigating potential risks and upholding ethical principles and human rights. ● Enact the draft Law on Personal Data Protection, aligning it with international standards. The draft should be analysed to protect people from data use in the public sector and by the government. ● Revise the Procurement law to adapt to acquiring AI systems safely in government. ● Revise and update the Criminal Code to adequately address specific AI harms not covered in the regulatory framework. Mechanisms of liability and readdress specific to AI harms should be developed. ● Enact a Freedom and Access to Information law: Revise the current draft to incorporate elements that can grant people access to information regarding the government's use of AI. 95 https://www.iso.org/standard/81230.html 47 ● Deliberative process towards AI regulation: Start a regulatory agenda and discussion to assess how to regulate AI, analysing how existing trends (e.g., risk-based approach, sectoral regulation, self-regulation, etc.) fit Cambodia’s reality to design a specific framework for the country. Timeline: 2025-2026 Priority: High Potential partners: Industry associations, academia, NGOs that work in digital-related areas, and international organisations 2.2. Implement AI Regulatory Sandboxes Different recommendations advocate for a shift towards more flexible, agile, and risk-based approaches to AI regulation. Regulatory sandboxes are highlighted as a potential mechanism to achieve this flexibility by providing controlled environments for experimentation, learning, and adaptation of regulatory frameworks in response to the rapid advancements in AI technologies. Cambodia should adopt a structured and phased approach to develop a regulatory sandbox for AI, considering its current AI ecosystem, legal framewor",
