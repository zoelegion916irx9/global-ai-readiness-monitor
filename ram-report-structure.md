4. Economic → Stage 5
5. Technical and Infrastructural → Stage 6

Stages 1, 7, 8 are qualitative/narrative (not scored).

- **Qualitative**: Each dimension has rich sub-sections with findings
- **Recommendations**: Structured with dimension, number, text, timeline, priority
- **Recommendations table** (p.81) is highly structured — perfect for dashboard display
- **Stakeholder engagement** section could feed a "methodology" view
